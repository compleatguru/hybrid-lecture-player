      <span id="lineID0003" begin="00:00:18.872" end="00:00:22.610">So first of all Bonjour and Welcome in <br/>the Canadian Embassy in Germany</span>

      <span id="lineID0006" begin="00:00:26.690" end="00:00:29.885">Specifically in the Marshall McLuhan <br/>Salon here in the Embassy.</span>

</p>
<p id="paragraph002">
      <span id="lineID0008" begin="00:00:32.401" end="00:00:36.265">I have the great pleasure of introducing <br/>or welcome you all </span>
      <span id="lineID0009" begin="00:00:36.265" end="00:00:37.095">here to our salon<br/></span>
      <span id="lineID0010" begin="00:00:37.095" end="00:00:42.405">which has the largest McLuhan archive in <br/>Europe, something we're very proud of</span>
      <span id="lineID0011" begin="00:00:42.405" end="00:00:44.517">I'm not gonna say a whole lot</span>
      <span id="lineID0012" begin="00:00:44.517" end="00:00:47.479">I will pass the torch on to Stephen Kovats</span>
      <span id="lineID0013" begin="00:00:47.929" end="00:00:50.753">who is another great Canadian</span>
      <span id="lineID0014" begin="00:00:51.193" end="00:00:52.828">working and living here in Berlin</span>
      <span id="lineID0015" begin="00:00:53.007" end="00:00:56.974">and someone we have been working with <br/>very closely in the last couple of years</span>
      <span id="lineID0016" begin="00:00:57.206" end="00:01:01.975">And he is the initiator <br/>and director of the McLuhan in Europe</span>
<p id="paragraph003">
      <span id="lineID0017" begin="00:01:03.006" end="00:01:05.314">Of course this is the centennial year <br/>as we know</span>
      <span id="lineID0018" begin="00:01:06.516" end="00:01:11.697">And this is 1 of 30 events that is taking <br/>place in throughout Europe about McLuhan</span>
      <span id="lineID0019" begin="00:01:11.731" end="00:01:16.242">We are very, very happy to have Stephen <br/>and of course Graham with us here today</span>
      <span id="lineID0020" begin="00:01:16.508" end="00:01:20.686">So I will all see you tomorrow <br/>I will pass this on now to Stephen Kovats</span>
      <span id="lineID0021" begin="00:01:20.686" end="00:01:24.740">to say now a little bit about Mr. Larkin <br/>Thank you.</span>

<p id="paragraph004">
      <h3>Steve Kovats</h3>
      <span id="lineID0022" begin="00:01:25.341" end="00:01:27.872">OK. Thank you very much, Sarah, and also</span>
      <span id="lineID0023" begin="00:01:28.690" end="00:01:32.377">Welcome to everybody who made it <br/>this afternoon!</span>
      <span id="lineID0024" begin="00:01:32.736" end="00:01:38.645">It's not quite evening yet <br/>even though it's getting dark already</span>
      <span id="lineID0025" begin="00:01:40.397" end="00:01:46.657">I just want to make a little brief, <br/>I guess, pre-intro because</span>
      <span id="lineID0026" begin="00:01:47.236" end="00:01:49.010"><br/>having Graham Larkin here</span>
      <span id="lineID0027" begin="00:01:50.016" end="00:01:53.490">other the fact that it's a great honor <br/>and pleasure to have you here</span>
      <span id="lineID0028" begin="00:01:54.193" end="00:01:58.820">he's actually the last speaker <br/>of our Re-Touching McLuhan conference</span>
      <span id="lineID0029" begin="00:01:59.422" end="00:02:02.751">which took place at the end of May <br/>earlier this year (2011)</span>
      <span id="lineID0030" begin="00:02:03.410" end="00:02:07.311">And so the pamphlets <br/>which are sitting out here</span>
      <span id="lineID0031" begin="00:02:07.598" end="00:02:10.337">which are labelled 27th-29th of May </span>
      <span id="lineID0032" begin="00:02:10.622" end="00:02:14.694">are actually still valid for this evening</span>
      <span id="lineID0033" begin="00:02:15.144" end="00:02:17.874">they work also for today</span>
      <span id="lineID0034" begin="00:02:18.096" end="00:02:20.722">Unfortunately, Graham Larkin <br/>wasn't able to make it</span>
      <span id="lineID0035" begin="00:02:21.075" end="00:02:23.596">at the last minute to the conference, <br/>then.</span>
      <span id="lineID0036" begin="00:02:25.136" end="00:02:28.416">And it's fantastic that we were able <br/>to get him today</span>
      <span id="lineID0037" begin="00:02:29.466" end="00:02:32.069">to give his lecture</span>
      <span id="lineID0038" begin="00:02:32.579" end="00:02:35.820">and in doing so, <br/>he's got the opportunity now</span>
      <span id="lineID0039" begin="00:02:36.122" end="00:02:40.261">which wasn't really possible <br/>in the context of the original conference </span>
      <span id="lineID0040" begin="00:02:40.646" end="00:02:44.411">to do a much broader lecture <br/>about his work.</span>

<p id="paragraph005">
      <span id="lineID0041" begin="00:02:46.884" end="00:02:50.209">Graham Larkin is an art historian</span>
      <span id="lineID0042" begin="00:02:50.592" end="00:02:53.452">He is a McLuhan scholar and researcher</span>
      <span id="lineID0043" begin="00:02:55.025" end="00:02:58.334">We first met in the summer of last year</span>
      <span id="lineID0044" begin="00:02:58.917" end="00:03:05.685">when we were researching, preparing for <br/>McLuhan events here in Berlin and Europe</span>
      <span id="lineID0045" begin="00:03:06.367" end="00:03:10.732">Graham is doing some <br/>really amazing research</span>
      <span id="lineID0046" begin="00:03:11.177" end="00:03:15.325">into the physical archives <br/>of McLuhan's work</span>
      <span id="lineID0047" begin="00:03:15.705" end="00:03:18.816">so, what the McLuhan Salon here has</span>
      <span id="lineID0048" begin="00:03:19.204" end="00:03:24.369">is a fantastic selection of the <br/>audiovisual material from McLuhan's</span>
      <span id="lineID0049" begin="00:03:24.659" end="00:03:26.924">McLuhan broadcast material</span>
      <span id="lineID0050" begin="00:03:27.262" end="00:03:30.207">But the actual documents, <br/>the physical stuff...</span>
      <span id="lineID0051" begin="00:03:30.207" end="00:03:33.426">the writings and particularly the collages<br/></span>
      <span id="lineID0052" begin="00:03:33.901" end="00:03:38.624">and other sort of handmade artifacts of <br/>McLuhan of a</span>
      <span id="lineID0053" begin="00:03:38.953" end="00:03:44.734">large part are sitting in the national <br/>archives of Canada and in other places.</span>
      <span id="lineID0054" begin="00:03:45.023" end="00:03:52.420">and this is primarily where <br/>Graham Larkin is doing his research.</span>

<p id="paragraph006">
      <span id="lineID0055" begin="00:03:52.970" end="00:03:58.216">And the conference, <br/>that we ran back in May</span>
      <span id="lineID0056" begin="00:03:58.216" end="00:04:02.230">which was curated by Dieter Daniels <br/>who is also here this evening.</span>
      <span id="lineID0057" begin="00:04:02.351" end="00:04:04.792">So, Dieter, great that you could make it!</span>
      <span id="lineID0058" begin="00:04:04.792" end="00:04:08.313">And Martina Leeker, who was also <br/>one of the speakers of the conference.</span>
      <span id="lineID0059" begin="00:04:08.313" end="00:04:10.536">it's nice to have you two as well here</span>
      <span id="lineID0060" begin="00:04:18.624" end="00:04:22.379">... is dealing primarily <br/>with tactility and media</span>
      <span id="lineID0061" begin="00:04:22.826" end="00:04:27.067">and how this is seen in McLuhan's work</span>
      <span id="lineID0062" begin="00:04:27.145" end="00:04:30.635">and how it relates to <br/>digital practice today.</span>
      <span id="lineID0063" begin="00:04:32.664" end="00:04:36.174">I'd also like to very briefly point out,</span>
      <span id="lineID0064" begin="00:04:36.224" end="00:04:41.989">welcome and introduce Baruch Gottlieb, <br/>back there in the red sweater</span>
      <span id="lineID0065" begin="00:04:42.500" end="00:04:46.021">and Steffi Winkler over here in the back</span>
      <span id="lineID0066" begin="00:04:46.058" end="00:04:49.798">because together with Steffi and Baruch</span>
      <span id="lineID0067" begin="00:04:49.798" end="00:04:52.380">we've been doing other <br/>McLuhan's centennial events this year</span>
      <span id="lineID0068" begin="00:04:52.405" end="00:04:55.305">primarily McLuminations, screenings...</span>
      <span id="lineID0069" begin="00:04:55.305" end="00:04:58.417">some of you, I think, <br/>have been to those as well</span>
      <span id="lineID0070" begin="00:04:58.429" end="00:05:02.990">where they put together with <br/>special guests.</span>
      <span id="lineID0071" begin="00:05:03.467" end="00:05:06.045">Last one we did with Martina Leeker</span>
      <span id="lineID0072" begin="00:05:06.782" end="00:05:09.908">where material from the broadcast archives </span>
      <span id="lineID0073" begin="00:05:10.002" end="00:05:15.505">are taken out, presented, commented, <br/>deconstructed, reconstructed</span>
      <span id="lineID0074" begin="00:05:17.588" end="00:05:21.412">We've had our official last <br/>"McLuminations" of the year</span>
      <span id="lineID0075" begin="00:05:21.442" end="00:05:22.781">a couple of weeks ago</span>
      <span id="lineID0076" begin="00:05:22.781" end="00:05:25.359">But I'm hoping they will be able to do <br/>some more of them</span>
      <span id="lineID0077" begin="00:05:25.359" end="00:05:29.256">even though if it's not <br/>the centennial year any more</span>

<p id="paragraph007">
      <span id="lineID0078" begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:32.817">I also like to give a quick thank you</span>
      <span id="lineID0079" begin="00:05:33.144" end="00:05:35.675">to Andrea Boegner</span>
      <span id="lineID0080" begin="00:05:35.876" end="00:05:42.543">Andrea works together with Sarah on <br/>programming here in the McLuhan Salon</span>
      <span id="lineID0081" begin="00:05:43.031" end="00:05:48.000">She was also the main person helping <br/>to organize this event</span>
      <span id="lineID0082" begin="00:05:48.322" end="00:05:51.508">together with Anja Meier who is behind <br/>the camera over there</span>
      <span id="lineID0083" begin="00:05:51.789" end="00:05:54.221">Unfortunately, Andrea had an injury</span>
      <span id="lineID0084" begin="00:05:54.456" end="00:05:57.857">so she can't be here this evening.</span>
      <span id="lineID0085" begin="00:05:58.918" end="00:06:02.960">Also a very big thank you, for all the <br/>other McLuhan events</span>
      <span id="lineID0086" begin="00:06:02.975" end="00:06:05.266">that we were doing this year.</span>

      <span id="lineID0088" begin="00:06:10.101" end="00:06:15.016">because this is kind of our last <br/>real McLuhan event here this year.</span>
      <span id="lineID0089" begin="00:06:18.191" end="00:06:21.740">I just really wanted to give you guys <br/>also from the embassy a big thank you</span>
      <span id="lineID0090" begin="00:06:21.740" end="00:06:27.221">and also to St&#233;phane Charbonneau who is <br/>the, not the attach&#233;</span>
      <span id="lineID0091" begin="00:06:27.438" end="00:06:30.330">but the counselor for cultural affairs</span>
      <span id="lineID0092" begin="00:06:30.967" end="00:06:37.485">he was also primarily responsible in <br/>getting funding together</span>
      <span id="lineID0093" begin="00:06:37.489" end="00:06:40.076">so that we could invite Graham Larkin here</span>

<p id="paragraph008">
      <span id="lineID0094" begin="00:06:40.076" end="00:06:43.158">So, Graham, again, it is a great pleasure <br/>to have you here</span>

<p id="paragraph010">
      <span id="lineID0112" begin="00:07:47.334" end="00:07:49.744">So, the McLuhan archive... </span>
      <span id="lineID0113" begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:54.764">You said I was interested in the documents</span>
      <span id="lineID0114" begin="00:07:55.197" end="00:07:56.601">As opposed to the audiovisual stuff</span>
      <span id="lineID0115" begin="00:07:56.866" end="00:07:58.476">Well, for me it's sort of all one</span>
      <span id="lineID0116" begin="00:07:59.085" end="00:08:01.498">And really one of the things, <br/>I'm trying to do</span>
      <span id="lineID0117" begin="00:08:01.549" end="00:08:05.506">with my limited time and limited <br/>powerpointing abilities</span>
      <span id="lineID0118" begin="00:08:05.639" end="00:08:10.328">is give you a sense of <br/>the real range of material</span>
      <span id="lineID0119" begin="00:08:10.583" end="00:08:12.962">much of paper-based</span>
      <span id="lineID0120" begin="00:08:13.449" end="00:08:17.620">much of it based in this gigantic archive <br/>of Library &amp; Archives Canada</span>

      <span id="lineID0123" begin="00:08:25.455" end="00:08:27.818">and many of them, photocopies <br/>or articles or whatever</span>
      <span id="lineID0124" begin="00:08:27.881" end="00:08:30.456">but a lot of original stuff and <br/>manuscripts and typescripts</span>
      <span id="lineID0125" begin="00:08:30.594" end="00:08:36.649">and I try to give you a flavor <br/>of the variety and depth of that material</span>
      <span id="lineID0126" begin="00:08:37.891" end="00:08:41.401">But, I think, I'll begin just by saying</span>
      <span id="lineID0127" begin="00:08:43.329" end="00:08:47.940">why I'm doing what I'm doing <br/>with McLuhan.</span>
      <span id="lineID0128" begin="00:08:49.369" end="00:08:54.148">It really has largely to do with </span>
      <span id="lineID0129" begin="00:08:55.845" end="00:08:56.641">my feeling that</span>
      <span id="lineID0130" begin="00:08:58.086" end="00:08:59.164">we tend to see McLuhan</span>
      <span id="lineID0131" begin="00:09:00.378" end="00:09:01.536">above all, I think as...</span>
      <span id="lineID0132" begin="00:09:02.316" end="00:09:03.852">We tend to put him in certain boxes.</span>
      <span id="lineID0133" begin="00:09:04.822" end="00:09:06.810">and we see him&#11834;and rightly so.</span>
      <span id="lineID0134" begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:10.052">I mean, he really was an kind of <br/>initiator of discourses</span>
      <span id="lineID0135" begin="00:09:10.436" end="00:09:14.683">to use Foucault's phrase <br/>that he said about Marx and Freud.</span>
      <span id="lineID0136" begin="00:09:15.464" end="00:09:22.740">But, he really kind of invented, to an <br/>amazing extent, cultural studies</span>
      <span id="lineID0137" begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:27.076">with The Mechanical Bride, the 1951 book, <br/>along with a few others</span>
      <span id="lineID0138" begin="00:09:27.473" end="00:09:30.159">But that was really a big deal, <br/>especially in the English speaking world.</span>
      <span id="lineID0139" begin="00:09:30.201" end="00:09:36.527">And we didn't know in the English <br/>speaking world about Kracauer or Benjamin</span>
      <span id="lineID0140" begin="00:09:36.884" end="00:09:40.819">or, you know, people who were sort of <br/>doing what could become cultural studies</span>
      <span id="lineID0141" begin="00:09:40.842" end="00:09:42.649">those translations didn't happen till later</span>
      <span id="lineID0142" begin="00:09:42.714" end="00:09:44.611">that was only in the English <br/>speaking world</span>
      <span id="lineID0143" begin="00:09:44.767" end="00:09:47.687">that was really, people here and there</span>
      <span id="lineID0144" begin="00:09:47.850" end="00:09:50.378">There was Robert Warshaw <br/>or there was Gilbert Seldes, or whatever</span>
      <span id="lineID0145" begin="00:09:50.828" end="00:09:53.683">But it was really McLuhan who kind of <br/>wrote a book on it and brought it together</span>
      <span id="lineID0146" begin="00:09:54.017" end="00:09:57.595">with this book published in 1951.</span>
      <span id="lineID0147" begin="00:09:59.425" end="00:10:03.118">So, as with cultural studies, <br/>he also, of course</span>
      <span id="lineID0148" begin="00:10:03.605" end="00:10:09.831">is a hugely foundational figure <br/>for communication studies, as well.</span>
      <span id="lineID0149" begin="00:10:11.341" end="00:10:15.999">And in a way, <br/>probably to the greatest extent,</span>
      <span id="lineID0150" begin="00:10:16.200" end="00:10:20.809">he has been studied as a theorist</span>
      <span id="lineID0151" begin="00:10:22.773" end="00:10:27.938">in communication studies and that's <br/>a discipline, I guess it's a discipline</span>
      <span id="lineID0152" begin="00:10:28.714" end="00:10:30.053">it's alive and well.</span>
      <span id="lineID0153" begin="00:10:31.923" end="00:10:37.224">An interdisciplinary thing that's <br/>branching off into</span>
      <span id="lineID0154" begin="00:10:37.569" end="00:10:40.107">media ecology and all kinds of things</span>
      <span id="lineID0155" begin="00:10:42.295" end="00:10:43.773">And my feeling is that </span>
      <span id="lineID0156" begin="00:10:44.006" end="00:10:45.473">this McLuhan that I'm saying </span>
      <span id="lineID0157" begin="00:10:45.678" end="00:10:50.097">has been taken care of and <br/>really attended to by scholars</span>
      <span id="lineID0158" begin="00:10:51.670" end="00:10:53.954">is the theorist. </span>
      <span id="lineID0159" begin="00:10:55.943" end="00:11:00.405">And I think that it's ironic</span>
      <span id="lineID0160" begin="00:11:01.870" end="00:11:06.635">how little has been done on <br/>the material aspects of his practice.</span>
      <span id="lineID0161" begin="00:11:07.708" end="00:11:13.413">Given the fact that he felt <br/>the medium is the message.</span>
      <span id="lineID0162" begin="00:11:14.794" end="00:11:18.718">And given the fact, that he said, </span>
      <span id="lineID0163" begin="00:11:20.441" end="00:11:22.246">"I have percepts about concepts".</span>
      <span id="lineID0164" begin="00:11:24.077" end="00:11:29.603">and said, that his, correctly in a way, <br/>that his probes and explorations</span>
      <span id="lineID0165" begin="00:11:30.642" end="00:11:34.941">didn't really add up to anything as <br/>rigorous as a theory.</span>
      <span id="lineID0166" begin="00:11:37.530" end="00:11:42.253">And so, what I'm trying to do, <br/>is sort of </span>
      <span id="lineID0167" begin="00:11:43.206" end="00:11:46.039">get with the program a little bit, after <br/>a hundred years</span>
      <span id="lineID0168" begin="00:11:46.420" end="00:11:49.149">and apply some of his own methods</span>
      <span id="lineID0169" begin="00:11:50.403" end="00:11:56.472">to his own work, <br/>that is, to look at the media environment</span>
      <span id="lineID0170" begin="00:11:56.501" end="00:11:57.916">that he was embedded in </span>
      <span id="lineID0171" begin="00:11:58.406" end="00:12:01.454">and in all of the traces of his own, <br/>what I call his media practice.</span>
      <span id="lineID0172" begin="00:12:02.360" end="00:12:07.227">And by that, I mean, <br/>not only his productions</span>
      <span id="lineID0173" begin="00:12:07.389" end="00:12:08.960">but also his receptions</span>
      <span id="lineID0174" begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:11.032">and you'll see what I mean by that.</span>
      <span id="lineID0175" begin="00:12:11.032" end="00:12:12.265">But basically every... </span>
      <span id="lineID0176" begin="00:12:13.826" end="00:12:15.382">We're lucky that the archive is so rich</span>
      <span id="lineID0177" begin="00:12:15.420" end="00:12:17.315">it looks like he just threw nothing away</span>
      <span id="lineID0178" begin="00:12:17.341" end="00:12:18.947">So, we basically have every piece of paper</span>
      <span id="lineID0179" begin="00:12:18.956" end="00:12:20.682">that passed through his hands <br/>and then some.</span>
      <span id="lineID0180" begin="00:12:22.416" end="00:12:26.037">And a lot of traces of his <br/>encounters with other media.</span>
      <span id="lineID0181" begin="00:12:27.870" end="00:12:33.197">Radio, film, TV and so on.</span>
      <span id="lineID0182" begin="00:12:34.110" end="00:12:36.584">So, that's really what <br/>I'm going to be unpacking for you.</span>
      <span id="lineID0183" begin="00:12:36.662" end="00:12:39.541">But as a way in... <br/>what I'm gonna do, is </span>
      <span id="lineID0184" begin="00:12:40.219" end="00:12:43.141">just start a slideshow here </span>
      <span id="lineID0185" begin="00:12:43.778" end="00:12:47.989">and maybe try to navigate this space <br/></span>
      <span id="lineID0186" begin="00:12:48.013" end="00:12:51.840">in a way that allows you to look <br/>at the images and at me</span>
      <span id="lineID0187" begin="00:12:52.443" end="00:12:56.683">And, give you a little bit of the story <br/>of how I got&#11834;came to McLuhan.</span>
      <span id="lineID0188" begin="00:12:56.953" end="00:12:59.319">Because in my day job, <br/>up until very recently,</span>
      <span id="lineID0189" begin="00:12:59.319" end="00:13:01.831">I was curator of painting, sculpture <br/>and decorative arts. So, basically</span>
      <span id="lineID0190" begin="00:13:01.969" end="00:13:04.150">European &amp; American sculpture with art <br/>at the National Gallery of Canada.</span>
      <span id="lineID0191" begin="00:13:06.331" end="00:13:08.513">I was trained as an art historian. </span>
      <span id="lineID0192" begin="00:13:09.613" end="00:13:11.308">and really actually a historian in print</span>
      <span id="lineID0193" begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:15.466">And I gonna go back now <br/>to a conference</span>
      <span id="lineID0194" begin="00:13:16.191" end="00:13:21.202">that I co-hosted in 1998 <br/>at Harvard University</span>
      <span id="lineID0195" begin="00:13:21.432" end="00:13:22.617">when I was a student there.</span>
      <span id="lineID0196" begin="00:13:22.976" end="00:13:25.428">Doing my doctoral studies, called </span>
      <span id="lineID0197" begin="00:13:25.889" end="00:13:30.140">"Printing Matters: The Materiality of <br/>Print in Early Modern Europe"</span>
      <span id="lineID0198" begin="00:13:30.274" end="00:13:34.694">This was a opportunity to bring together</span>
      <span id="lineID0199" begin="00:13:36.517" end="00:13:41.102">historians of the printed word, <br/>really literally historians</span>
      <span id="lineID0200" begin="00:13:41.311" end="00:13:43.115">who were sort of leaning that way </span>

      <span id="lineID0201" begin="00:13:43.137" end="00:13:45.864">towards the kind of materialistic take <br/>on things</span>
      <span id="lineID0202" begin="00:13:45.953" end="00:13:48.549">and seeing how meaning is embedded <br/></span>
      <span id="lineID0203" begin="00:13:48.756" end="00:13:51.600">in particular modes of production.</span>
      <span id="lineID0204" begin="00:13:53.816" end="00:13:56.357">And historians of the printed image</span>
      <span id="lineID0205" begin="00:13:56.422" end="00:14:00.586">which I speak and Lisa Pon <br/>the other organizer</span>
      <span id="lineID0206" begin="00:14:01.856" end="00:14:06.330">And we published that in 2001 <br/>in the journal 'Word &amp; Image'</span>
      <span id="lineID0207" begin="00:14:07.173" end="00:14:10.405">and I did mention</span>
      <span id="lineID0208" begin="00:14:13.155" end="00:14:13.796">[skip that]</span>
      <span id="lineID0209" begin="00:14:15.007" end="00:14:17.392">the name of McLuhan as someone</span>
      <span id="lineID0210" begin="00:14:17.393" end="00:14:19.378">who was really a precursor to</span>
      <span id="lineID0211" begin="00:14:20.016" end="00:14:23.863">you know, important in this whole field.</span>
      <span id="lineID0212" begin="00:14:25.106" end="00:14:26.175">So, that's available.</span>
      <span id="lineID0213" begin="00:14:27.053" end="00:14:29.028">There is a postscript by Roger Chartier <br/></span>
      <span id="lineID0214" begin="00:14:29.694" end="00:14:31.190">who was kind enough to write for that</span>
      <span id="lineID0215" begin="00:14:31.533" end="00:14:34.394">that's in this journal 'Word &amp; Image', if <br/>you want to go there</span>
      <span id="lineID0216" begin="00:14:34.864" end="00:14:37.401">And I'm not even gonna try to summarize</span>
      <span id="lineID0217" begin="00:14:38.203" end="00:14:40.802">the other publications by other people</span>
      <span id="lineID0218" begin="00:14:41.030" end="00:14:42.372">that have happened in the mean time</span>
      <span id="lineID0219" begin="00:14:42.372" end="00:14:43.601">I mean, at the time, that we did that<br/></span>
      <span id="lineID0220" begin="00:14:43.728" end="00:14:46.249">the 90's were a very exciting time <br/>for book history.</span>
      <span id="lineID0221" begin="00:14:46.869" end="00:14:49.010">there's also Adrian Johns <br/>'The Nature of the Book'</span>
      <span id="lineID0222" begin="00:14:49.384" end="00:14:55.570">there was D.F. McKenzie <br/>who was a great book historian</span>
      <span id="lineID0223" begin="00:14:55.757" end="00:14:58.283">We were all at the time <br/>at the instability of print.</span>
      <span id="lineID0224" begin="00:14:58.987" end="00:15:00.593">So that was this particular moment</span>
      <span id="lineID0225" begin="00:15:01.179" end="00:15:02.964">But now I think, we're in a moment where</span>
      <span id="lineID0226" begin="00:15:03.277" end="00:15:05.283">we're seeing a lot of </span>
      <span id="lineID0227" begin="00:15:06.919" end="00:15:09.039">attention to things</span>
      <span id="lineID0228" begin="00:15:09.211" end="00:15:11.389">and I take almost as a, <br/>just as a sort of a</span>
      <span id="lineID0229" begin="00:15:11.701" end="00:15:14.648">fun and fairly indicative example</span>
      <span id="lineID0230" begin="00:15:16.925" end="00:15:19.028">sort of light and delightful book </span>
      <span id="lineID0231" begin="00:15:19.264" end="00:15:21.229">called "Taking Things Seriously"</span>
      <span id="lineID0232" begin="00:15:22.117" end="00:15:24.380">which is just a book </span>
      <span id="lineID0233" begin="00:15:24.563" end="00:15:26.033">published by Princeton Architectural Press</span>
      <span id="lineID0234" begin="00:15:26.245" end="00:15:27.316">that just shows </span>
      <span id="lineID0235" begin="00:15:30.757" end="00:15:32.754">little things from people's <br/>personal collections</span>
      <span id="lineID0236" begin="00:15:33.740" end="00:15:37.157">that are opposed to </span>
      <span id="lineID0237" begin="00:15:37.743" end="00:15:39.289">you know, on the left hand page</span>
      <span id="lineID0238" begin="00:15:39.289" end="00:15:42.514">there is whole text by the person <br/>saying, what this thing means to them</span>
      <span id="lineID0239" begin="00:15:42.809" end="00:15:44.371">So, there's a bit of this around.</span>
      <span id="lineID0240" begin="00:15:44.458" end="00:15:46.739">Obviously, that's just an example.</span>
      <span id="lineID0241" begin="00:15:48.375" end="00:15:50.427">And then, after the conference</span>
      <span id="lineID0242" begin="00:15:50.427" end="00:15:52.987">I ended up writing a doctoral dissertation</span>
      <span id="lineID0243" begin="00:15:53.248" end="00:16:00.180">on the, in this case, largely based <br/>on these 18th century print albums</span>
      <span id="lineID0244" begin="00:16:00.496" end="00:16:04.839">that became the basis <br/>for the first catalogue raisonn&#233;</span>
      <span id="lineID0245" begin="00:16:05.368" end="00:16:08.506">That was a catalogue <br/>of the oeuvre of the Jacques Callot</span>
      <span id="lineID0246" begin="00:16:08.984" end="00:16:11.591">of the great 17C print maker</span>
      <span id="lineID0247" begin="00:16:12.522" end="00:16:14.634">It was very, you can see, </span>
      <span id="lineID0248" begin="00:16:14.634" end="00:16:17.780">I got my hand on all of these photographs</span>
      <span id="lineID0249" begin="00:16:17.953" end="00:16:21.701">So, I have my hand in 2003 <br/>on the, even then,</span>
      <span id="lineID0250" begin="00:16:22.430" end="00:16:23.270">on the book </span>
      <span id="lineID0251" begin="00:16:24.087" end="00:16:28.535">not just as, again, <br/>to give you a sense of scale</span>
      <span id="lineID0252" begin="00:16:29.513" end="00:16:33.333">and of the function of the thing. </span>
      <span id="lineID0253" begin="00:16:34.180" end="00:16:38.168">And perhaps, some indication that <br/>I'm not afraid to touch it.</span>
      <span id="lineID0254" begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:45.542">You know, I think that too often <br/>when we look at media,</span>
      <span id="lineID0255" begin="00:16:45.542" end="00:16:47.334">as such as a printed book <br/>or a printed image</span>
      <span id="lineID0256" begin="00:16:47.334" end="00:16:49.238">things kind of get posterized. </span>
      <span id="lineID0257" begin="00:16:49.238" end="00:16:52.014">And you lose a sense of the, <br/>sort of, a texture</span>
      <span id="lineID0258" begin="00:16:53.254" end="00:16:55.245">and, you know, the full tactility. </span>
      <span id="lineID0259" begin="00:16:57.507" end="00:17:02.187">And so intersensory fulness of <br/>these objects.</span>
      <span id="lineID0260" begin="00:17:02.550" end="00:17:06.508">So, you see one of my hands in <br/>the images to follow</span>
      <span id="lineID0261" begin="00:17:09.283" end="00:17:13.627">[ok there you go] McLuhan doesn't <br/>appear in the bibliography, he would have</span>
      <span id="lineID0262" begin="00:17:13.886" end="00:17:15.432">been right in here in my dissertation <br/>But I think he's in some other place</span>
      <span id="lineID0263" begin="00:17:17.981" end="00:17:20.246">There is an example of these print albums </span>
      <span id="lineID0264" begin="00:17:20.408" end="00:17:22.936">that people were compiling at that time </span>
      <span id="lineID0265" begin="00:17:23.221" end="00:17:26.634">McLuhan himself wrote a <br/>doctoral dissertation</span>
      <span id="lineID0266" begin="00:17:26.822" end="00:17:31.840">on a 16C compiler, named Nashe</span>
      <span id="lineID0267" begin="00:17:32.649" end="00:17:35.713">So, it's kind of, I'm coming away from </span>
      <span id="lineID0268" begin="00:17:38.264" end="00:17:40.074">where he, pretty close to <br/>where he comes from.</span>
      <span id="lineID0269" begin="00:17:40.817" end="00:17:42.894">I'm even into having quotations</span>
      <span id="lineID0270" begin="00:17:42.982" end="00:17:45.505">as he is as well, he uses a lot of those</span>
      <span id="lineID0271" begin="00:17:45.944" end="00:17:48.106">And I am not afraid to </span>
      <span id="lineID0272" begin="00:17:54.278" end="00:17:54.785">to use collage of text, as well as images</span>
      <span id="lineID0273" begin="00:17:56.243" end="00:18:00.097">So, as I say, I was living in Ottawa</span>
      <span id="lineID0274" begin="00:18:02.555" end="00:18:05.471">Pretty much, down the street <br/>from where I worked at National Gallery</span>
      <span id="lineID0275" begin="00:18:06.029" end="00:18:08.057">was the Library and Archives of Canada.</span>
      <span id="lineID0276" begin="00:18:10.223" end="00:18:14.234">I was very excited about the possibility </span>
      <span id="lineID0277" begin="00:18:14.344" end="00:18:16.536">of doing something for the centennial <br/>of McLuhan</span>
      <span id="lineID0278" begin="00:18:17.014" end="00:18:19.107">But what I really wanted to do </span>
      <span id="lineID0279" begin="00:18:19.107" end="00:18:21.047">was to have an exhibition somewhere</span>
      <span id="lineID0280" begin="00:18:21.172" end="00:18:23.971">ideally at LAC, <br/>Library Archives Canada</span>
      <span id="lineID0281" begin="00:18:24.287" end="00:18:26.578">That would bring together </span>
      <span id="lineID0282" begin="00:18:27.277" end="00:18:28.841">Well, I had this idea, <br/>that I'd bring together</span>
      <span id="lineID0283" begin="00:18:28.861" end="00:18:31.480">a hundred objects and call it <br/>'McLuhan Century'</span>
      <span id="lineID0284" begin="00:18:32.438" end="00:18:35.047">There would be, a kind of a, very </span>
      <span id="lineID0285" begin="00:18:36.146" end="00:18:38.770">thick description, <br/>a reading of each of these objects</span>
      <span id="lineID0286" begin="00:18:39.330" end="00:18:42.687">that shows how it exemplifies his <br/>engagements</span>
      <span id="lineID0287" begin="00:18:43.028" end="00:18:44.856">with various kinds of media.</span>
      <span id="lineID0288" begin="00:18:46.861" end="00:18:50.719">And here, we have the detail of <br/>the webpage</span>
      <span id="lineID0289" begin="00:18:51.177" end="00:18:52.555">you can go onto the LAC webpage</span>
      <span id="lineID0290" begin="00:18:52.570" end="00:18:55.388">you can get a many hundreds of pages of </span>
      <span id="lineID0291" begin="00:18:55.388" end="00:18:57.043">a finding aid of the collection</span>
      <span id="lineID0292" begin="00:18:57.800" end="00:18:58.995">You can see here summarized</span>
      <span id="lineID0293" begin="00:18:59.639" end="00:19:02.630">just what's in 43.6 meters of <br/>textual records.</span>
      <span id="lineID0294" begin="00:19:02.951" end="00:19:04.274">That's 800,000 papers</span>
      <span id="lineID0295" begin="00:19:05.195" end="00:19:06.523">That's shelf meters</span>
      <span id="lineID0296" begin="00:19:08.310" end="00:19:10.058">And various other stuff. </span>
      <span id="lineID0297" begin="00:19:10.058" end="00:19:12.910">Including audio cassettes and <br/>audio discs and reels and films</span>
      <span id="lineID0298" begin="00:19:12.910" end="00:19:15.042">And some of these things are just stuff, <br/>it's just stuff he had</span>
      <span id="lineID0299" begin="00:19:15.679" end="00:19:19.541">so it might not be directly of him, <br/>its not necessarily of him</span>
      <span id="lineID0300" begin="00:19:20.173" end="00:19:24.202">Just as all the papers are not <br/>necessarily things written by him.</span>

      <span id="lineID0301" begin="00:19:24.456" end="00:19:27.543">But, it's all stuff <br/>that was from him</span>
      <span id="lineID0302" begin="00:19:27.543" end="00:19:30.703">and acquired and catalogued <br/>in the mid 80s.</span>
      <span id="lineID0303" begin="00:19:31.416" end="00:19:33.765">Once it was acquired.</span>
      <span id="lineID0304" begin="00:19:34.182" end="00:19:36.486">There really wasn't a lot of interest <br/>from Library &amp; Archives Canada</span>
      <span id="lineID0305" begin="00:19:36.486" end="00:19:39.600">There really wasn't <br/>a lot of interest from them.</span>
      <span id="lineID0306" begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:41.593">So, I kept coming back to them</span>
      <span id="lineID0307" begin="00:19:41.593" end="00:19:46.809">and I came with my buddy Dominique <br/>Scheffel-Dunand who is in Toronto.</span>
      <span id="lineID0308" begin="00:19:46.916" end="00:19:52.306">and who did a wonderful McLuhan festival <br/>along with Berlin, just the biggest</span>
      <span id="lineID0309" begin="00:19:52.452" end="00:19:54.700">McLuhan celebration this year, <br/>this centenary</span>
      <span id="lineID0310" begin="00:19:55.955" end="00:20:00.423">We tried to get something going with <br/>them, the Science &amp; Tech Museum.</span>
      <span id="lineID0311" begin="00:20:00.835" end="00:20:02.589">And again, about McLuhan's...</span>
      <span id="lineID0312" begin="00:20:02.589" end="00:20:06.371">There would be an exhibition of <br/>McLuhan's engagement with media.</span>
      <span id="lineID0313" begin="00:20:06.740" end="00:20:11.613">I popped into Robert Bean <br/>a photographer</span>
      <span id="lineID0314" begin="00:20:11.677" end="00:20:13.357">told him about the archive </span>
      <span id="lineID0315" begin="00:20:13.373" end="00:20:15.927">and he really ran with it and <br/>has done a number of exhibitions</span>
      <span id="lineID0316" begin="00:20:16.068" end="00:20:19.084">Now, we're actually looking, <br/>we're getting into the library now.</span>
      <span id="lineID0317" begin="00:20:19.300" end="00:20:21.111">For the moment, the photographs </span>
      <span id="lineID0318" begin="00:20:21.206" end="00:20:25.584">taken by Robert Bean, <br/>when he went there with me</span>
      <span id="lineID0319" begin="00:20:25.831" end="00:20:26.827">over a year ago.</span>
      <span id="lineID0320" begin="00:20:27.103" end="00:20:31.181">I think it was in around May of 2010 <br/>to get in there.</span>
      <span id="lineID0321" begin="00:20:31.181" end="00:20:33.835">Now we're in the reserve room.</span>
      <span id="lineID0322" begin="00:20:34.784" end="00:20:37.998">So, we're getting closer to the material</span>
      <span id="lineID0323" begin="00:20:38.432" end="00:20:39.663">And there we are, or I am</span>
      <span id="lineID0324" begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:45.326">And there: <br/>boxes of&#11834;from McLuhan Archive</span>
      <span id="lineID0325" begin="00:20:45.326" end="00:20:46.732">some of you may&#11834;</span>
      <span id="lineID0326" begin="00:20:46.732" end="00:20:49.991">Can we have a show hands, has someone <br/>actually been in the McLuhan Archive?</span>
      <span id="lineID0327" begin="00:20:50.655" end="00:20:51.846">Yeah, that's what I figured. </span>
      <span id="lineID0328" begin="00:20:51.873" end="00:20:54.061">I mean, in Canada, it's a rarity</span>
      <span id="lineID0329" begin="00:20:55.361" end="00:20:58.107">There's many McLuhan scholars <br/>who haven't been in there.</span>
      <span id="lineID0330" begin="00:20:58.151" end="00:21:00.899">So, that's good, this will <br/>be fresh for you.</span>
      <span id="lineID0331" begin="00:21:02.651" end="00:21:06.596">Here you can see, <br/>I'm looking at a scrapbook</span>
      <span id="lineID0332" begin="00:21:06.871" end="00:21:08.440">That was assembled in the 60s</span>
      <span id="lineID0333" begin="00:21:08.449" end="00:21:10.951">by McLuhan and I suspect </span>
      <span id="lineID0334" begin="00:21:11.071" end="00:21:15.302">Corinne, his wife, <br/>who did a lot of typing for him.</span>
      <span id="lineID0335" begin="00:21:20.790" end="00:21:22.536">I'm not afraid to touch these things.</span>
      <span id="lineID0336" begin="00:21:23.765" end="00:21:26.544">Now, this exhibition hall, <br/>I went to LAC</span>
      <span id="lineID0337" begin="00:21:26.544" end="00:21:28.726">if you go pass Glenn Gould's piano <br/>which is a bit sad</span>
      <span id="lineID0338" begin="00:21:28.726" end="00:21:31.648">because its unused and under this funny <br/>quilted thing.</span>
      <span id="lineID0339" begin="00:21:31.648" end="00:21:33.091">And you get to this area here </span>
      <span id="lineID0340" begin="00:21:33.095" end="00:21:35.137">which is this exhibition room </span>
      <span id="lineID0341" begin="00:21:35.162" end="00:21:37.593">There is an exhibition on there</span>
      <span id="lineID0342" begin="00:21:37.593" end="00:21:39.346">when I went with Dominique</span>
      <span id="lineID0343" begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:41.975">on Gabriel Roi, this Canadian author</span>
      <span id="lineID0344" begin="00:21:42.663" end="00:21:45.166">and we said, well, can we have it?</span>
      <span id="lineID0345" begin="00:21:45.446" end="00:21:48.700">for 2011 and do a McLuhan thing?</span>
      <span id="lineID0346" begin="00:21:49.263" end="00:21:51.107">They said, "No, no, no, we're done." </span>
      <span id="lineID0347" begin="00:21:51.107" end="00:21:53.181">We're not having any <br/>McLuhan exhibitions.</span>
      <span id="lineID0348" begin="00:21:53.181" end="00:21:54.976">We're going digital now.</span>
      <span id="lineID0349" begin="00:21:58.551" end="00:22:00.042">That's what it looks like now.</span>
      <span id="lineID0350" begin="00:22:00.231" end="00:22:02.592">There's nothing going on, anymore. </span>
      <span id="lineID0351" begin="00:22:06.203" end="00:22:07.176">They actually had to cut 40 positions </span>
      <span id="lineID0352" begin="00:22:07.577" end="00:22:10.054">in the last three years </span>
      <span id="lineID0353" begin="00:22:10.327" end="00:22:12.330">Just to have a National Gallery, <br/>including my own.</span>
      <span id="lineID0354" begin="00:22:14.420" end="00:22:17.792">It's a pretty rough time <br/>and it's a major library</span>
      <span id="lineID0355" begin="00:22:18.153" end="00:22:19.871">Most of the list <br/>I can find on the web</span>
      <span id="lineID0356" begin="00:22:19.976" end="00:22:21.812">the 4th biggest of the world</span>
      <span id="lineID0357" begin="00:22:23.303" end="00:22:26.223">That's the library not this list</span>
      <span id="lineID0358" begin="00:22:26.280" end="00:22:28.069">But I'm sure as archive as well</span>
      <span id="lineID0359" begin="00:22:28.241" end="00:22:29.566">It's substantial and yet</span>
      <span id="lineID0360" begin="00:22:29.713" end="00:22:31.618">It's a bit sepulchral in there these days</span>
      <span id="lineID0361" begin="00:22:31.823" end="00:22:35.842">It's a bit of a tomb</span>
      <span id="lineID0362" begin="00:22:37.818" end="00:22:39.763">So, that's the background</span>
      <span id="lineID0363" begin="00:22:40.675" end="00:22:42.462">And, what I was able to do, </span>
      <span id="lineID0364" begin="00:22:43.362" end="00:22:45.096">in lieu of an exhibition is</span>
      <span id="lineID0365" begin="00:22:46.505" end="00:22:47.744">the talk you're about to see,</span>
      <span id="lineID0366" begin="00:22:47.842" end="00:22:48.831"> the study you're about to see</span>
      <span id="lineID0367" begin="00:22:49.252" end="00:22:54.089">which is really the first time <br/>I'm coming out in public </span>
      <span id="lineID0368" begin="00:22:54.801" end="00:23:00.748">with my exposition on McLuhan's <br/>engagements with media</span>
      <span id="lineID0369" begin="00:23:00.922" end="00:23:02.066">The way I have set it up</span>
      <span id="lineID0370" begin="00:23:02.561" end="00:23:03.592">is thematically</span>
      <span id="lineID0371" begin="00:23:04.656" end="00:23:07.168">these themes are also <br/>pretty much chronological</span>
      <span id="lineID0372" begin="00:23:08.169" end="00:23:14.360">That is, they reflect whatever stage of <br/>McLuhan's practice that he's at.</span>
      <span id="lineID0373" begin="00:23:14.937" end="00:23:16.107">And like all of us,</span>
      <span id="lineID0374" begin="00:23:17.930" end="00:23:20.741">maybe we, we're talking before we watch TV</span>
      <span id="lineID0375" begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:22.297">So, we start with orality.</span>
      <span id="lineID0376" begin="00:23:25.669" end="00:23:27.722">Now, orality is, you know,</span>
      <span id="lineID0377" begin="00:23:28.542" end="00:23:32.964">is something that was <br/>of great interest to McLuhan</span>
      <span id="lineID0378" begin="00:23:34.752" end="00:23:38.502">He really, you know, he looked at <br/>speech as technology</span>
      <span id="lineID0379" begin="00:23:38.555" end="00:23:40.440">He looked at writing <br/>as a technology.</span>
      <span id="lineID0380" begin="00:23:40.440" end="00:23:42.980">He always had this big picture. </span>
      <span id="lineID0381" begin="00:23:44.471" end="00:23:49.952">In the studies in orality, of which there <br/>were many amazing ones in the 20th century</span>
      <span id="lineID0382" begin="00:23:50.621" end="00:23:54.228">His favourite and still my favourite, <br/>I think</span>

      <span id="lineID0384" begin="00:23:57.925" end="00:24:00.303">which is an incredible book <br/>that talks about</span>
      <span id="lineID0385" begin="00:24:01.008" end="00:24:03.392">the rise of literacy </span>
      <span id="lineID0386" begin="00:24:05.505" end="00:24:07.353">and what it meant for greek culture</span>
      <span id="lineID0387" begin="00:24:08.529" end="00:24:11.036">and what it meant for the oral culture</span>
      <span id="lineID0388" begin="00:24:11.733" end="00:24:13.397">and how it was a real game changer</span>
      <span id="lineID0389" begin="00:24:14.732" end="00:24:16.136">I'm also showing you a book </span>
      <span id="lineID0390" begin="00:24:16.136" end="00:24:20.364">by McLuhan's disciple/pupil</span>
      <span id="lineID0391" begin="00:24:21.033" end="00:24:22.921">He turns 100 next year <br/>by the way</span>
      <span id="lineID0392" begin="00:24:23.042" end="00:24:25.734">There's gonna be some <br/>celebration in St. Lewis in Walter Ong</span>
      <span id="lineID0393" begin="00:24:27.303" end="00:24:28.876">He wrote a book, </span>
      <span id="lineID0394" begin="00:24:28.876" end="00:24:30.909">sadly published 2 years after <br/>McLuhan's death.</span>
      <span id="lineID0395" begin="00:24:30.909" end="00:24:32.712">So this is published in 1982</span>
      <span id="lineID0396" begin="00:24:33.317" end="00:24:35.066">called "Orality and Literacy"</span>
      <span id="lineID0397" begin="00:24:35.324" end="00:24:36.927">which is really the best introduction <br/>to that subject</span>
      <span id="lineID0398" begin="00:24:37.234" end="00:24:39.376">It's a beautiful synopsis that </span>
      <span id="lineID0399" begin="00:24:40.088" end="00:24:43.512">coins the term secondary orality</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:24:43.642" end="00:24:47.788">to talk about what happens <br/>when we're literate</span>

      <span id="lineID0401" begin="00:24:48.385" end="00:24:56.293">but we're still experiencing <br/>various oral situations. </span>
      <span id="lineID0402" begin="00:24:56.993" end="00:24:59.322">It's a kind of overlay </span>
      <span id="lineID0403" begin="00:24:59.739" end="00:25:00.648">and it's very good </span>
      <span id="lineID0404" begin="00:25:00.762" end="00:25:03.993">it's a reminder that it's not one thing <br/>just transplants another</span>
      <span id="lineID0405" begin="00:25:04.435" end="00:25:06.504">or fully succeeds another</span>
      <span id="lineID0406" begin="00:25:06.504" end="00:25:09.331">Things get hybrid, <br/>as McLuhan would say.</span>
      <span id="lineID0407" begin="00:25:10.592" end="00:25:13.074">And now, we gonna go back <br/>to the first object</span>
      <span id="lineID0408" begin="00:25:13.715" end="00:25:15.501">I'm going to show you from the archive</span>
      <span id="lineID0409" begin="00:25:16.506" end="00:25:22.353">What it is, is evidence of McLuhan's <br/>pre-literate phase</span>
      <span id="lineID0410" begin="00:25:23.323" end="00:25:24.668">It's a letter from his grandma</span>
      <span id="lineID0411" begin="00:25:26.512" end="00:25:28.122">That it's just on a scrap of paper <br/>there is one side</span>
      <span id="lineID0412" begin="00:25:28.138" end="00:25:29.546">and there is the other side.</span>
      <span id="lineID0413" begin="00:25:30.036" end="00:25:31.248">And it says: "Dear Marshall,..." </span>
      <span id="lineID0414" begin="00:25:31.248" end="00:25:32.705">So, we're now.. </span>
      <span id="lineID0415" begin="00:25:33.205" end="00:25:34.933">he was born in 1911. </span>
      <span id="lineID0416" begin="00:25:35.203" end="00:25:38.443">So, we're maybe 1916 something like that.</span>
      <span id="lineID0417" begin="00:25:39.227" end="00:25:41.922">and we can pin-point it a little bit</span>
      <span id="lineID0418" begin="00:25:42.283" end="00:25:43.668">As you will see...</span>
      <span id="lineID0419" begin="00:25:43.702" end="00:25:45.511">"Dear Marshall, so far away..."</span>
      <span id="lineID0420" begin="00:25:50.609" end="00:25:52.220">"I would like..."</span>
      <span id="lineID0421" begin="00:25:53.831" end="00:25:55.442">-- Sorry, it's harder to read off here -- <br/>"I would like to see you so much</span>
      <span id="lineID0422" begin="00:25:55.442" end="00:25:57.070">but you are so far away. </span>
      <span id="lineID0423" begin="00:25:58.225" end="00:26:00.953">I hope to see you all some time<br/>in warm weather.</span>
      <span id="lineID0424" begin="00:26:01.937" end="00:26:05.534">We're having great cold, much colder <br/>weather here than last winter.</span>
      <span id="lineID0425" begin="00:26:06.751" end="00:26:09.391">And I'm glad, you're trying to study! <br/>Keep at it!</span>
      <span id="lineID0426" begin="00:26:11.238" end="00:26:13.918">And you can soon learn to read and write.</span>
      <span id="lineID0427" begin="00:26:15.876" end="00:26:19.559">Then I know, you will write me a letter <br/>with your own dear hand."</span>
      <span id="lineID0428" begin="00:26:20.644" end="00:26:22.016">So, Marshall doesn't know how to write <br/>yet, read or write yet</span>
      <span id="lineID0429" begin="00:26:25.712" end="00:26:30.037">This is a scribbling -- <br/>almost certainly by the young Marshall</span>
      <span id="lineID0430" begin="00:26:31.569" end="00:26:34.773">on the back of mimiograph </span>
      <span id="lineID0431" begin="00:26:35.495" end="00:26:36.882">that is dated from 1915.</span>
      <span id="lineID0432" begin="00:26:39.673" end="00:26:41.631">Which is a great special interest of me</span>
      <span id="lineID0433" begin="00:26:41.631" end="00:26:46.088">because McLuhan he became a real <br/>power-user of mimiographs.</span>
      <span id="lineID0434" begin="00:26:46.403" end="00:26:49.113">By ca. 1950 / 51. </span>
      <span id="lineID0435" begin="00:26:49.926" end="00:26:54.001">He was really into self-publishing</span>
      <span id="lineID0436" begin="00:26:55.593" end="00:26:59.513">Things were kind of proto-blogs in 1951 </span>
      <span id="lineID0437" begin="00:26:59.513" end="00:27:01.932">The mimiograph was the way to do that.</span>
      <span id="lineID0438" begin="00:27:06.082" end="00:27:06.974">So now, we get to his literacy.</span>
      <span id="lineID0439" begin="00:27:08.734" end="00:27:09.950">And I want to emphasize </span>
      <span id="lineID0440" begin="00:27:10.750" end="00:27:13.514">the reception as much as the production</span>
      <span id="lineID0441" begin="00:27:14.338" end="00:27:15.716">of this media environment. </span>
      <span id="lineID0442" begin="00:27:18.922" end="00:27:23.079">So, here's a valentine to Marshall <br/>from a secret admirer.</span>
      <span id="lineID0443" begin="00:27:24.941" end="00:27:27.553">That he doubtless received at a <br/>very young age.</span>
      <span id="lineID0444" begin="00:27:29.636" end="00:27:32.297">Here, is Marshall practicing his cursives</span>
      <span id="lineID0445" begin="00:27:32.736" end="00:27:34.683">So, you can see Marshall at the top </span>
      <span id="lineID0446" begin="00:27:35.265" end="00:27:37.078">and then various writing exercises,</span>
      <span id="lineID0447" begin="00:27:37.078" end="00:27:38.421">This is the sort of check bar, </span>
      <span id="lineID0448" begin="00:27:38.421" end="00:27:39.467">for the teacher to show</span>
      <span id="lineID0449" begin="00:27:39.467" end="00:27:45.500">that it's been properly surveilled <br/>by the teacher.</span>
      <span id="lineID0450" begin="00:27:46.494" end="00:27:48.303">This is a kind of examples </span>
      <span id="lineID0451" begin="00:27:48.455" end="00:27:52.025">I don't need to convince you <br/>that he knew how to read and write. </span>
      <span id="lineID0452" begin="00:27:52.762" end="00:27:54.336">But I just want to <br/>give you a taste</span>
      <span id="lineID0453" begin="00:27:54.713" end="00:27:58.374">of the archive, by showing you <br/>this collection of cigar bands</span>
      <span id="lineID0454" begin="00:27:58.487" end="00:28:01.812">that were in a book that Marshall owned.</span>
      <span id="lineID0455" begin="00:28:02.597" end="00:28:04.469">And I like it on many levels. </span>
      <span id="lineID0456" begin="00:28:04.479" end="00:28:06.009">But not least because</span>
      <span id="lineID0457" begin="00:28:06.668" end="00:28:09.082">it really shows <br/>text and image together.</span>
      <span id="lineID0458" begin="00:28:10.864" end="00:28:13.704">I think in some way it kind of shows</span>
      <span id="lineID0459" begin="00:28:13.730" end="00:28:15.354">the inseparability of these things.</span>
      <span id="lineID0460" begin="00:28:16.050" end="00:28:19.794">It shows that print is often --</span>
      <span id="lineID0461" begin="00:28:20.195" end="00:28:23.449">-- image, as well, as text, or image <br/>mixed in with text it's complicated.</span>
      <span id="lineID0462" begin="00:28:27.201" end="00:28:28.986">-- Something went wrong with this slide --</span>

      <span id="lineID0464" begin="00:28:35.343" end="00:28:37.878">So here we get to radio</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:11.426" end="00:31:12.921">and in diaries, especially.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:16.870" end="00:31:18.558">Another piece of evidence <br/>from the archive </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:19.309" end="00:31:23.651">of the very detailed particular <br/>McLuhan's media practice</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:25.451" end="00:31:28.365">are these lists of expenses</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:29.508" end="00:31:30.729">And I certainly encourage you, <br/>to go up</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:30.729" end="00:31:32.125">and some people <br/>are starting to do</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:32.527" end="00:31:36.029">and go and take a look <br/>at the nearest screen.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:37.304" end="00:31:39.646">This one starts... the first thing it <br/>says is flick</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:41.806" end="00:31:44.390">That means he went to a movie and it <br/>cost 1 --</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:44.390" end="00:31:49.262">It's all -- I guess, it's all schillings <br/>and pence here So, "Flick"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:49.262" end="00:31:51.587">And we don't know what that was because <br/>he doesn't say because it says </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:51.587" end="00:31:53.912">George Arliss as the Last Gentleman.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:53.912" end="00:31:56.238">And we know what that was.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:56.238" end="00:31:59.007">That was this movie from 1935</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:31:59.858" end="00:32:03.277">And then he says, to see "Mrs. Wiggs <br/>of the Cabbage Patch" down here</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:03.418" end="00:32:04.459">We know what that was</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:04.462" end="00:32:08.364">That was this W.C. Fields movie <br/>from the same year.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:08.970" end="00:32:10.726">And then, he also has read books </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:10.888" end="00:32:12.326">Here's "Dream of John Ball"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:13.764" end="00:32:15.204">is a book by William Morris. And so on.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:16.167" end="00:32:18.339">So, we really know exactly </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:19.611" end="00:32:20.544">what he's doing.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:20.797" end="00:32:23.790">Here's another reference which says <br/>Mickey Mouse bill of the Cosmopolitan</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:24.419" end="00:32:26.683">That's the movie theater <br/>and we know what he paid for.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:26.683" end="00:32:29.807">We don't know what that was. At least <br/>not in this source alone</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:30.867" end="00:32:32.272">Flick, movie, and 'La Maternelle'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:33.518" end="00:32:35.364">We know what that was, 'cause that came <br/>out that year.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:35.664" end="00:32:37.536">So, one can actually go</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:37.536" end="00:32:39.282">and reconstruct with great exactitude</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:41.008" end="00:32:44.605">exactly which movies <br/>Marshall was looking at</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:44.768" end="00:32:47.328">and which radio he was listening to <br/>and so on... at a given time</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:47.328" end="00:32:49.844">I think, it's terribly important </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:51.748" end="00:32:53.822">for the following reason:</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:56.694" end="00:32:59.247">I'm kind of a McLuhan sceptic in many ways</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:32:59.247" end="00:33:01.860">and one of the things, <br/>I felt about his theories</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:06.660">was that there weren't necessarily <br/>as well researched as they should be </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:07.400" end="00:33:08.834">You know and there are a little bit...</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:09.378" end="00:33:10.799">you know, <br/>a book like 'Understanding Media'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:13.226">is almost biting up more than you can chew</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:13.226" end="00:33:15.696">I mean, how can you possibly know really</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:15.696" end="00:33:16.958">about all this media, come on!</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:17.278" end="00:33:19.297">It was a really important synthesis</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:19.728" end="00:33:21.484">and it's really a useful book</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:21.605" end="00:33:24.500">But also though well <br/>how well researched can this be?</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:25.454" end="00:33:26.833">But when you think about it,</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:29.301" end="00:33:32.106">we all have deep experience <br/>with all kinds of media </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:32.692" end="00:33:33.755">throughout our lives.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:33.755" end="00:33:35.141">I think, <br/>it was his life experience</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:35.141" end="00:33:37.485">that really gave McLuhan <br/>that kind of expertise</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:37.855" end="00:33:38.951">in combination with the fact</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:38.951" end="00:33:39.911">that he was paying attention</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:39.911" end="00:33:41.924">he was, as he used to say,</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:41.924" end="00:33:45.206">"The fish that was paying attention <br/>to the water"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:46.874" end="00:33:49.012">So, in looking at these details, <br/>I come to think</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:51.150" end="00:33:53.290">Well, sure, of course he <br/>knew what a movie was</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:56.376" end="00:33:59.372">Another example...</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:33:59.372" end="00:34:02.368">Viva Villa this movie about the <br/>Mexican revolution.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:02.368" end="00:34:05.366">it was a stirring picture excellently <br/>produced and so on.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:05.461" end="00:34:07.856">I mean, there is tons of this evidence</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:08.718" end="00:34:11.107">And then, of course, <br/>I show his view of his office</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:11.107" end="00:34:11.897">Just because it has a TV</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:11.897" end="00:34:13.660">and I don't need to remind you <br/>of the fact</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:13.660" end="00:34:19.870">that he commented a lot on TV <br/>and how supplanted print</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:20.914" end="00:34:22.480">There's something funny about <br/>these headers</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:24.312">I think, we just see very partial views </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:25.690" end="00:34:27.449">Maybe it's just a thought font <br/>that's going funny</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:28.944" end="00:34:30.419">This section is called </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:30.419" end="00:34:31.563">"Being a Character"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:31.862" end="00:34:34.441">As I said, he's a kind of thematic <br/>and kind of chronological</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:34.764" end="00:34:37.198">and why I am interested in this <br/>little section</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:38.018" end="00:34:39.259">is really talking about </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:39.989" end="00:34:42.398">McLuhan's interest in rethoric</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:43.453" end="00:34:46.566">And not the least in the performative <br/>aspects of the rhetor</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:50.514" end="00:34:52.075">Of which his mother was one.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:55.049">As you may know</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:34:55.049" end="00:34:59.502">Elsie McLuhan was a, what was called, <br/>an elocutionist</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:00.121" end="00:35:03.130">Or as we see here a reader <br/>and impersonator</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:03.759" end="00:35:09.595">which in the pre-cinema age was a way <br/>you got your kicks, was going out</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:09.677" end="00:35:12.288">and seeing these kind of <br/>vaudeville-type shows.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:12.486" end="00:35:15.164">of various types.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:16.187" end="00:35:18.476">That would sometimes consist of people <br/>getting up on a stage and </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:18.476" end="00:35:19.750">giving recitations.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:20.770" end="00:35:26.638">Original or else straight up <br/>annotations or</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:26.638" end="00:35:28.843">Recitations of anything, really.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:29.545" end="00:35:30.740">High and low</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:30.740" end="00:35:32.506">And that's what she, his mother, </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:32.506" end="00:35:34.303">- the very mother <br/>to whom he was writing -</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:34.385" end="00:35:38.076">with such alacrity about <br/>about whatever latest movie he'd seen</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:38.271" end="00:35:40.754">That's what she did for a living <br/>back in Canada.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:41.761" end="00:35:44.082">And there's a picture, and a detail -<br/></span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:44.225" end="00:35:45.773">of that same photo that has a TV in it.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:47.494" end="00:35:51.246">And she's very, very important to Marshall</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:51.433" end="00:35:53.338">much more so than his father</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:55.083" end="00:35:56.512">And now I'm gonna show you </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:35:56.809" end="00:36:00.107">a document from 1933</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:01.048" end="00:36:08.875">which is the brochure that is the <br/>commemoration of the graduation,</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:08.888" end="00:36:17.679">Marshall's graduation in 1933 <br/>from his M.A. at University of Manitoba</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:18.095" end="00:36:21.105">And, what's interesting, is that, <br/>of course</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:21.105" end="00:36:22.920">they've got valedictory addresses, <br/>and so on</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:22.920" end="00:36:24.599">But what's interesting is how McLuhan </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:25.162" end="00:36:26.303">makes these notes. </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:26.821" end="00:36:30.573">So, I guess, this is prof. H.N.Fieldhouse <br/>"who talked about cheese"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:31.350" end="00:36:33.862">And this other, <br/>I am not sure which one of these</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:33.862" end="00:36:35.930">was John Thomson or Thelma Wright</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:36.876" end="00:36:39.986">"Who showed the advantages of <br/>Miss Mitchell's training"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:40.361" end="00:36:44.142">Maybe this is someone, <br/>who was training kids in rethoric</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:44.469" end="00:36:46.621">And then on the back -- he doesn't stop</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:46.638" end="00:36:49.142">he then goes in the back, <br/>the whole thing is covered </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:49.436" end="00:36:52.219">and he just goes on and on in great detail</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:52.247" end="00:36:56.728">in this sort of assessment <br/>of his performances of the academy</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:36:58.108" end="00:37:00.307">Black spoke in puerile poly syllables</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:02.057" end="00:37:10.344">of the osbornian variety sons of the <br/>Osbornian curiosity or something?</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:10.770" end="00:37:15.626">He really goes in great detail in these <br/>analyses of people's rhetorical skills.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:18.201" end="00:37:19.712">And here he is again, next year</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:19.769" end="00:37:26.337">Now, we're in Cambridge this is <br/>the fall term of 1934</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:26.337" end="00:37:28.634">when he started at the <br/>University of Cambridge in England</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:29.305" end="00:37:32.886">And sure enough he's going to debates <br/>and annoting heavily</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:34.031" end="00:37:41.625">So, Mr. Alport was "business-like, <br/>monotone, patting Britain on the back"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:43.330" end="00:37:47.416">Mr. I.M.C. Braby <br/>was "frightfully confident"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:47.789" end="00:37:50.157">"Sing-song enunciation marked by levity"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:51.085" end="00:37:53.501">Mr. A. Duff Cooper was "fiery" - <br/>and you know, etc.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:37:55.398" end="00:38:03.054">So, he was very quite deep into <br/>this aspect of orality.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:04.565" end="00:38:07.810">About the performative aspect of speaking</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:08.876" end="00:38:09.805">and now, I'm showing you, </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:10.451" end="00:38:12.887">is a book called "A Character Anthology"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:13.229" end="00:38:14.583">One of the unpublished books, </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:14.589" end="00:38:18.932">one of the, quite a few, <br/>unpublished big studies that he</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:46.489" end="00:38:47.221">Well it's complicated.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:47.468" end="00:38:49.140">There was the 17th century</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:49.683" end="00:38:52.294">In the early 17th century <br/>throughout much of Europe</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:52.513" end="00:38:54.727">it was common to have these <br/>books of characters</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:38:54.727" end="00:38:56.458">that were based on this ancient writer</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:39:47.140" end="00:39:51.254">including a book <br/>that eventually became</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:13.460" end="00:40:14.748">I tell you what that is in a second</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:14.908" end="00:40:16.315">But I want to show you </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:16.461" end="00:40:18.171">there are also these scrapbook pages</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:18.479" end="00:40:20.245">also portions of scrapbook pages</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:24.875" end="00:40:26.812">And, what it is... </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:27.460" end="00:40:28.766">is the book that,</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:28.766" end="00:40:30.897">after one other name change, became</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:37.955" end="00:40:39.988">It's MB or McBride. So theres reams <br/>of them</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:44.140" end="00:40:47.516">l mean just -- <br/>it goes on and on.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:48.223" end="00:40:49.822">Then we have manuscripts </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:50.068" end="00:40:53.165">in this case for the introduction <br/>to the "Mechanical Bride"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:53.631" end="00:40:55.016">we have typescripts </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:57.157" end="00:40:59.121">and then, among all these files </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:40:59.121" end="00:41:00.768">we sometimes have even the original files <br/>that he had </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:00.768" end="00:41:02.415">If there is something</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:02.415" end="00:41:04.063">with some writing on it</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:04.063" end="00:41:06.268">like this one called "Beautiful Bodies" <br/>which was one of his</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:06.268" end="00:41:08.209">exhibits, he called, </span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:16.063" end="00:41:18.537">Usually it's just a single advertisement <br/>-- there is one the book became in the end</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:18.593" end="00:41:21.823">This one is called 'Beautiful Bodies'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:21.903" end="00:41:22.885">I think it came in the same one</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:23.360" end="00:41:25.449">It's hard to keep track <br/>after seeing all these</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:25.450" end="00:41:27.609">Because there's hundreds, I think, </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:27.609" end="00:41:29.334">and many didn't even make it into</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:29.334" end="00:41:32.091">the 50 that actually became <br/>the Mechanical Bride</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:32.091" end="00:41:35.713">This "Beautiful Bodies" was about a</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:36.338" end="00:41:39.946">kind of pin-up advertisement <br/>for a funeral home</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:40.513" end="00:41:42.186">which greatly amused him.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:42.343" end="00:41:44.182">And so he thought: <br/>I gotta write about this.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:47.960" end="00:41:50.792">-- why is that not going forward --</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:50.946" end="00:41:52.157">Here's another one</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:52.157" end="00:41:52.961">This one is originally called </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:52.961" end="00:41:53.765">"Hygiene" and then he had a snappier title</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:53.765" end="00:41:54.570">"How Not to Offend"</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:41:59.949">and that's all about <br/>various hygiene products</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:41:59.949" end="00:42:03.845">like deodorants .. or</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:04.774" end="00:42:06.082">tooth paste or mouth wash</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:07.370" end="00:42:09.807">and here to what we have, <br/>is all of the clippings</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:10.115" end="00:42:13.606">in the eventual book that is <br/>the "Mechanical Bride" </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:13.833" end="00:42:15.299">all we have is one image.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:15.901" end="00:42:18.708">And his son Eric tells me, that <br/>the images in that book</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:19.197" end="00:42:22.405">were actually made from slides </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:22.562" end="00:42:24.906">and that Mechanical Bride in the 1940s </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:24.906" end="00:42:27.550">started out as a kind of <br/>travelling slide lecture</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:27.752" end="00:42:28.907">which is very interesting</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:30.658" end="00:42:32.914">so they are actually quite fading <br/>and beat up</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:33.177" end="00:42:34.887">by the time they became these </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:35.515" end="00:42:40.990">rather grungy -you know- illustrations <br/>for the 'The Mechanical Bride'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:41.035" end="00:42:43.775">We have a lot of the original material</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:43.775" end="00:42:45.011">from which the slides were taken </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:45.020" end="00:42:46.556">and much, much more</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:46.761" end="00:42:48.481">Here you can see multiple copies </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:48.503" end="00:42:51.526">of the L'il Abner which is one that did <br/>make it into the final book.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:54.383" end="00:42:56.656">it was this idea of the exhibit</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:42:57.281" end="00:43:00.260">which we'll also see pop up <br/>later on in his work</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:00.688" end="00:43:04.374">came from a book, ... came chiefly <br/>from a book</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:04.374" end="00:43:07.254">by his hero and sometime pen-pal <br/>Wyndham Lewis</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:07.419" end="00:43:09.941">who wrote a book, <br/>called 'The Doom of Youth'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:09.941" end="00:43:12.782">in which, in the back, had a bunch of </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:13.656" end="00:43:19.664">had this section, an appendix <br/>that consisted of transcriptions of</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:20.153" end="00:43:22.548">newspaper clippings <br/>and that was all textual</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:22.783" end="00:43:25.115">But McLuhan did it <br/>in a kind of different way.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:25.115" end="00:43:26.717">He was looking at text and image together</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:27.297" end="00:43:28.823">in The Mechanical Bride.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:29.781" end="00:43:32.240">Brick Bradford start with that exact comic</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:32.244" end="00:43:34.454">and here is some other stuff in <br/>the same file.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:34.594" end="00:43:38.045">Flash Gordon. Brick Bradford was a kind <br/>of Flash Gordon, spaceman type.</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:44.572" end="00:43:45.840">but he certainly did have -you know-</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:45.840" end="00:43:47.149">he would collect things like</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:48.709" end="00:43:52.550">and look at it -- as he would say <br/>-- "like a work of art."</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:54.037" end="00:43:57.887">And here, we have the manuscript <br/>and a typescript for</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:43:58.507" end="00:44:00.627">that opening section <br/>of 'The Mechanical Bride'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:44:00.627" end="00:44:04.140">which I think, there is a copy <br/>that is being passed around.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:44:04.245" end="00:44:07.990">A very recent re-edition of that. <br/>I invite you to look at that.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:44:10.065" end="00:44:11.328">And now this is very important.</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:46:32.825" end="00:46:36.942">It just took him like 5 or 6 years <br/>to really find a publisher</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:46:51.895" end="00:46:52.806">he said "Argh... awful things."</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:47:05.237" end="00:47:06.651">Much more, probably, spontaneous. </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:47:07.953" end="00:47:09.049">And so he really wasn't happy.</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:47:24.770" end="00:47:27.819">Now a publication</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:47:28.051" end="00:47:29.317">that did make him happy</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:47:32.733" end="00:47:37.092">And 'Counterblast' was a book <br/>that came out in 1954.</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:47:40.691" end="00:47:44.328">his buddy Ted Carpenter, the <br/>anthropologist,</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:47:46.417" end="00:47:48.377">brought to his attention <br/>something that is generally called </span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:47:49.900" end="00:47:52.942">which was a federal document </span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:48:01.190" end="00:48:04.702">And Marshall McLuhan just thought it was <br/>the most hilarious thing he had ever read.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:48:06.303" end="00:48:07.619">And he immediately set to work</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:48:08.650" end="00:48:12.208">in writing a kind of parodic commentary </span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:48:26.744" end="00:48:27.746">so he's been kind of playing in there.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:48:29.717" end="00:48:32.463">And as you can see <br/>there's a lot of futuristic</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:48:47.711" end="00:48:49.433">that was really, very dear to Marshall</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:48:49.615" end="00:48:50.768">and he had more control over.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:48:51.269" end="00:48:57.096">And that was, I suppose, typically <br/>satisfying because it was collaborative</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:48:57.429" end="00:48:59.002">which is something that we'll see <br/>more and more of too</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:49:07.183" end="00:49:08.645">And these are the 5 copies </span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:51:29.985" end="00:51:34.320">They kind of got it right the first time <br/>as a work of typography.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:51:34.530" end="00:51:35.643">If you look closely,</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:51:36.796" end="00:51:41.936">you really see how very radical <br/>a book it is.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:51:41.936" end="00:51:43.888">Ok, we've got the big callouts</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:51:46.116" end="00:51:47.896">What's really amazing about this,</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:51:47.921" end="00:51:50.185">is all this slightly smaller font here</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:51:51.806" end="00:51:54.498">Just big chunks of quotation</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:51:58.387" end="00:52:02.453">have this mashup of other people's <br/>writings and call it a book.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:02.925" end="00:52:05.265">That is not an adequate description <br/>of what it is</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:05.265" end="00:52:09.271">But it is a description of what goes on </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:09.540" end="00:52:10.450">in a lot of this book </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:10.450" end="00:52:17.381">It is certainly not, you know, in line <br/>with academic norms either then or now</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:20.216" end="00:52:22.212">And here are the typographer's <br/>instructions</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:26.113" end="00:52:30.036">I just gonna show you very glancingly </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:30.036" end="00:52:33.227">that there's lots of this evidence <br/>for this very beautiful book.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:33.727" end="00:52:36.183">And look at that logo that they got <br/>made for this as well.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:36.478" end="00:52:41.112">A really great, great design for 1962.</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:52:56.199" end="00:52:59.019">to do the project in <br/>'Understanding New Media'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:00.773" end="00:53:02.493">These are some bits of this</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:03.409" end="00:53:04.303">What we have here -- </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:04.544" end="00:53:05.836">-- this is actually a students' survey</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:05.961" end="00:53:07.237">to which I was referring</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:08.728" end="00:53:10.678">Here it is tabulated</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:11.768" end="00:53:16.260">There it is in the original archival form <br/>of the graph</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:16.442" end="00:53:18.371">that got reprinted in 'Explorations'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:19.046" end="00:53:22.449">Someone read mimeographs, someone <br/>read print</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:22.895" end="00:53:25.510">television, lecturing. The comprehension <br/>levels are different.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:26.714" end="00:53:28.756">There's lots of evidence for this</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:29.403" end="00:53:32.205">this study -- a very important study <br/>in 1959 --</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:35.128" end="00:53:36.419">No one really looked at it in <br/>the archivally</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:39.261" end="00:53:41.057">And here is the uncorrected proof </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:41.313" end="00:53:43.305">of the report on <br/>'Understanding New Media'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:43.575" end="00:53:45.641">So, this is the book, the kind of </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:46.323" end="00:53:48.602">initial version of 'Understanding Media'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:48.852" end="00:53:50.485">which had a fairly different form</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:52.191" end="00:53:53.202">and so, there we go --</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:53.733" end="00:53:55.341">there is his bound copy and as you can see</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:55.341" end="00:53:56.848">It does what 'Understanding Media' does.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:53:56.848" end="00:54:00.171">the 1960 book that takes each</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:02.537" end="00:54:05.097">medium and discusses it separately</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:05.323" end="00:54:06.725">in this case, a kind of dry approach</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:07.051" end="00:54:10.594">same thing that happened in <br/>'The Mechanical Bride'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:10.932" end="00:54:13.950">he eventually jazzes it up <br/>for the final version.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:15.504" end="00:54:16.866">It has exhibits, you know about those.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:18.196" end="00:54:19.558">these are appendices.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:20.912" end="00:54:22.104">Here's one of the appendices </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:22.104" end="00:54:23.742">Exhibit two!</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:23.742" end="00:54:28.126">And what it is... It's a transcript of <br/>a 1960 television program</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:28.126" end="00:54:31.140">that helped Marshall put it together</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:31.329" end="00:54:36.827">for CBC. Cause it started <br/>Marshal McLuhan being Marshall McLuhan</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:37.992" end="00:54:42.322">and already, I mean very much <br/>being Marshall McLuhan already in 1960.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:50.727">That's a cover of my copy of <br/>'Understanding Media', the '64 book</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:51.078" end="00:54:52.040">But there's the </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:54:52.302" end="00:54:58.606">the jazzier the paperback version</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:00.892" end="00:55:06.250">1967 was the year of the great book <br/>'The Medium is the Massage'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:06.602" end="00:55:09.823">I don't need to go <br/>to the history of that book.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:10.072" end="00:55:10.322">other book, produced by <br/>Jerome Agel and Quentin Fiore</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:10.322" end="00:55:16.302">along with McLuhan</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:16.559" end="00:55:19.570">Because, this week, it's coming out</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:19.845" end="00:55:21.714">brand new book on the subject <br/>by Jeffrey Schnapp</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:22.066" end="00:55:22.915">which is incredible.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:23.374" end="00:55:24.582">I think, it's one of the best things, </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:24.762" end="00:55:25.865">published on McLuhan</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:26.337" end="00:55:29.461">in recent years. </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:30.937" end="00:55:31.709">It's very interesting.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:31.792" end="00:55:33.045">It's really about</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:35.467" end="00:55:40.034">this impressario, <br/>this new kind of publisher Jerome Agel</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:40.677" end="00:55:43.513">I don't know how to pronounce his name <br/>A-G-E-L</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:50.089" end="00:55:52.913">He put together Marshall McLuhan <br/>and the designer Quentin Fiore</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:52.913" end="00:55:55.737">to make the book <br/>'The Medium is the Massage'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:55.737" end="00:55:58.562">but also many many other books </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:55:59.197" end="00:56:01.251">Some of which were bombed <br/>some of which were successes</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:01.539" end="00:56:04.785">and the masterpiece is actually the book <br/>on Buckminster Fuller</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:05.040" end="00:56:06.392">Called 'I seem to be a Verb'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:06.544" end="00:56:08.936">It's incredible. <br/>It's an amazing book.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:09.048" end="00:56:12.289">and still, very much, you know, <br/>you can buy it used</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:14.328" end="00:56:17.249">And I really recommend it. <br/>Also Carl Sagan and others</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:17.398" end="00:56:21.604">So that 'Medium is a Massage' <br/>was part of a series</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:21.787" end="00:56:23.984">featuring various kind of intellectuals </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:25.582" end="00:56:27.881">It also came out, <br/>as many of you may know, </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:28.184" end="00:56:28.561">in LP form. </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:31.875" end="00:56:34.692">Also, as you may or may not know, </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:35.472" end="00:56:37.661">it came out as 'Aspen 4'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:38.313" end="00:56:39.312">which is a magazine in a box.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:40.139" end="00:56:43.289">In issue 4 Aspen was designed</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:43.688" end="00:56:45.067">'The Medium is a Massage'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:45.738" end="00:56:48.500">It was designed by Quentin Fiore</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:48.953" end="00:56:51.386">It was really all the text </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:53.057" end="00:56:55.281">and no doubt, many of the ideas</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:55.673" end="00:56:59.734">for the design as well came from <br/>Marshall McLuhan</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:56:59.810" end="00:57:01.615">It's this kind of grab-bag. Here's a poster.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:02.514" end="00:57:07.591">Here's various little booklets and things <br/>that it consists of</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:09.366" end="00:57:10.328">Beautifully, lavishly produced.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:11.691" end="00:57:13.767">I'm sorry about to dwell on any of this</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:14.047" end="00:57:16.637">But what I'm really trying to do is, <br/>saturate you with </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:17.252" end="00:57:21.335">a sense of the totality of this </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:21.844" end="00:57:25.159">and the kind of feeling, <br/>and the texture of it.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:28.109" end="00:57:32.211">69 McLuhan had the means</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:32.395" end="00:57:36.519">to produce a much fancier version of <br/>'Counterblast'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:37.475" end="00:57:40.267">So that is the book 'Counterblast' <br/>the one that up until this year</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:40.489" end="00:57:43.612">was the only really fully published version</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:43.837" end="00:57:45.422">opposed to these mimeographs <br/>that he sent out.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:50.748" end="00:57:53.634">And now for something really unknown </span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:54.123" end="00:57:55.366">and really quite special</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:57.120" end="00:57:58.308">which are these publications,</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:57:59.324" end="00:58:00.223">series of publications,</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:58:00.349" end="00:58:01.868">called 'The DEW Line Reports'</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:58:02.611" end="00:58:04.873">and you know about McLuhan and the <br/>DEW Line</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:58:05.059" end="00:58:07.902">the idea of the distance <br/>early warning system</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:58:08.357" end="00:58:12.836">and how Canadian culture <br/>is a kind of DEW line</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:58:13.369" end="00:58:14.419">because we can, kind of, <br/>see American culture coming</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="00:58:18.096" end="00:58:20.378">Just like we didn't see American, <br/>you know,</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="01:02:22.425" end="01:02:23.343">You have to see the original</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="01:02:23.586" end="01:02:25.648">because it's in this kind of newsprint</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="01:02:35.473" end="01:02:37.083">This is the most unprepossessing one</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="01:02:43.167" end="01:02:44.402">I think this is actually the original</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="01:02:44.857" end="01:02:48.400">And it's deliberately looking <br/>sort of grungy</span>

      <span id="lineID0400" begin="01:03:21.444" end="01:03:23.203">So pretty fancy after all, isn't it?</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="01:03:32.670" end="01:03:34.456">This looks to me like <br/>a kind of 50s thing.</span>
      <span id="lineID0400" begin="01:03:34.964" end="01:03:36.463">Now they're getting retro there again</span>
