            <p begin="00:00:03.436" end="00:00:05.748">So, ladies and gentleman, <br/>if you'd like to take a seat</p>
            <p begin="00:00:05.748" end="00:00:07.303">We're going to be starting shortly.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:18.872" end="00:00:22.610">First of all [French] Bonjour et bienvenue <br/>&#224; l'Ambassade du Canada ici &#224; Berlin.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:22.866" end="00:00:25.099">[German] Herzlich Willkommen in der <br/>Kanadischen Botschaft in Berlin </p>
            <p begin="00:00:25.384" end="00:00:26.468">Welcome to the Canadian Embassy;</p>
            <p begin="00:00:26.690" end="00:00:29.885">specifically in the Marshall McLuhan <br/>Salon here in our Embassy.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:30.125" end="00:00:32.401">We're really happy to have you here tonight</p>
            <p begin="00:00:32.401" end="00:00:36.265">I have the great pleasure of introducing <br/>or welcoming you all</p>
            <p begin="00:00:36.265" end="00:00:37.095">here to our Salon</p>
            <p begin="00:00:37.095" end="00:00:42.405">which has the largest McLuhan archive in all of<br/>Europe, something we're very proud of.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:42.405" end="00:00:44.517">I'm not going to say a whole lot.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:44.517" end="00:00:47.479">I think I will pass the torch on to Stephen Kovats</p>
            <p begin="00:00:47.929" end="00:00:50.753">who is another great Canadian</p>
            <p begin="00:00:51.193" end="00:00:52.828">working and living here in Berlin</p>
            <p begin="00:00:53.007" end="00:00:56.974">and someone we have been working with <br/>very closely in the last couple of years.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:57.206" end="00:01:01.975">And he is the initiator <br/>and director of McLuhan in Europe.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:03.006" end="00:01:05.314">Of course this is the centennial year, <br/>as you all know.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:06.516" end="00:01:11.697">And this is one of thirty events taking place<br/>throughout Europe about McLuhan.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:11.731" end="00:01:16.242">So we're very very happy to have Stephen <br/>and of course Graham with us here today.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:16.508" end="00:01:20.686">So I will all see you tomorrow won't say any more.<br/>I will pass this on now to Stephen Kovats</p>
            <p begin="00:01:20.686" end="00:01:24.740">who will now say now a little bit about Mr. Larkin <br/>Thank you.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:25.341" end="00:01:27.872">OK. Thank you very much, Sarah, and also</p>
            <p begin="00:01:28.690" end="00:01:32.377">welcome to everybody who made it <br/>this afternoon.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:32.736" end="00:01:38.645">It's not quite evening yet, <br/>even though it's getting dark already.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:40.397" end="00:01:46.657">I just wanted to make a little brief, <br/>I guess, pre-intro because</p>
            <p begin="00:01:47.236" end="00:01:49.010"><br/>having Graham Larkin here</p>
            <p begin="00:01:50.016" end="00:01:53.490">other the fact that it's a great honor <br/>and pleasure to have you here</p>
            <p begin="00:01:54.193" end="00:01:58.820">he's actually the last speaker <br/>of our Re-Touching McLuhan conference</p>
            <p begin="00:01:59.422" end="00:02:02.751">which took place at the end of May <br/>earlier this year [2011]</p>
            <p begin="00:02:03.410" end="00:02:07.311">And so the pamphlets <br/>which are sitting out here</p>
            <p begin="00:02:07.598" end="00:02:10.337">which are labelled 27th-29th of May </p>
            <p begin="00:02:10.622" end="00:02:14.694">are actually [still valid for this evening].</p>
            <p begin="00:02:15.144" end="00:02:17.874">They work also for today.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:18.096" end="00:02:20.722">Unfortunately, Graham Larkin <br/>wasn't able to make it</p>
            <p begin="00:02:21.075" end="00:02:23.596">at the last minute to the conference, <br/>then.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:25.136" end="00:02:28.416">And it's fantastic that we were able <br/>to get him today</p>
            <p begin="00:02:29.466" end="00:02:32.069">to give his lecture</p>
            <p begin="00:02:32.579" end="00:02:35.820">and in doing so, <br/>he's got the opportunity now</p>
            <p begin="00:02:36.122" end="00:02:40.261">which wasn't really possible <br/>in the context of the original conference </p>
            <p begin="00:02:40.646" end="00:02:44.411">to do a much broader lecture <br/>about his work.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:46.884" end="00:02:50.209">Graham Larkin is an art historian.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:50.592" end="00:02:53.452">He's a McLuhan scholar and researcher.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:55.025" end="00:02:58.334">We first met in the summer of last year</p>
            <p begin="00:02:58.917" end="00:03:05.685">when we were researching, preparing for <br/>McLuhan events here in Berlin and in Europe.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:06.367" end="00:03:10.732">Graham was doing some <br/>really amazing research</p>
            <p begin="00:03:11.177" end="00:03:15.325">into the <span tts:fontStyle="italic">physical</span> archives <br/>of McLuhan's work.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:15.705" end="00:03:18.816">So what the McLuhan Salon here has</p>
            <p begin="00:03:19.204" end="00:03:24.369">is a fantastic selection of the <br/>audiovisual material from McLuhan:</p>
            <p begin="00:03:24.659" end="00:03:26.924">McLuhan broadcast material.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:27.262" end="00:03:30.207">But the actual documents, <br/>the physical stuff,</p>
            <p begin="00:03:30.207" end="00:03:33.426">the writings and particularly the collages<br/></p>
            <p begin="00:03:33.901" end="00:03:38.624">and other sort of handmade artifacts of <br/>McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:03:38.953" end="00:03:44.734">for the large part are sitting in the national <br/>archives of Canada and in other places.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:45.023" end="00:03:52.420">And this is primarily where <br/>Graham Larkin is doing his research.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:52.970" end="00:03:58.216">And the conference <br/>that we ran back in May</p>
            <p begin="00:03:58.216" end="00:04:02.230">which was curated by Dieter Daniels <br/>who is also here this evening.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:02.351" end="00:04:04.792">So, Dieter, great that you could make it!</p>
            <p begin="00:04:04.792" end="00:04:07.713">And Martina Leeker, who was also <br/>one of the speakers of the conference.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:07.783" end="00:04:10.306">it's nice to have you two as well here --</p>
            <p begin="00:04:10.621" end="00:04:14.361">so that we have a little bit of the <br/>conference gang also together --</p>
            <p begin="00:04:16.984" end="00:04:22.379">was dealing primarily <br/>with tactility and media</p>
            <p begin="00:04:22.826" end="00:04:27.067">and how this is seen in McLuhan's work</p>
            <p begin="00:04:27.145" end="00:04:30.635">and how it relates to <br/>digital practice today.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:32.664" end="00:04:36.174">I'd also like to very briefly point out,</p>
            <p begin="00:04:36.224" end="00:04:41.989">welcome and introduce Baruch Gottlieb, <br/>back there in the red sweater</p>
            <p begin="00:04:42.500" end="00:04:46.021">and Steffi Winkler over here in the back.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:46.058" end="00:04:49.798">Because together <br/>with Steffi and Baruch</p>
            <p begin="00:04:49.798" end="00:04:52.380">we've been doing other <br/>McLuhan centennial events this year</p>
            <p begin="00:04:52.405" end="00:04:55.305">primarily McLuminations, screenings.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:55.305" end="00:04:58.417">Some of you, I think, <br/>have been to those as well</p>
            <p begin="00:04:58.429" end="00:05:02.990">where they put together, with <br/>special guests --</p>
            <p begin="00:05:03.467" end="00:05:06.045">the last one we did <br/>with Martina Leeker --</p>
            <p begin="00:05:06.782" end="00:05:09.908">where material from <br/>the broadcast archives</p>
            <p begin="00:05:10.002" end="00:05:15.505">are taken out, presented, commented, <br/>deconstructed, reconstructed --</p>
            <p begin="00:05:17.588" end="00:05:21.412">and we've had, I guess, our official last <br/>"McLuminations" of the year</p>
            <p begin="00:05:21.442" end="00:05:22.781">a couple of weeks ago</p>
            <p begin="00:05:22.781" end="00:05:25.359">but I'm hoping they will be able to do <br/>some more of them</p>
            <p begin="00:05:25.359" end="00:05:29.256">even though if it's not <br/>the centennial year any more.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:32.817">I'd also like to give a quick thank you</p>
            <p begin="00:05:33.144" end="00:05:35.675">to Andrea Boegner.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:35.876" end="00:05:42.543">Andrea works together with Sarah on <br/>programming here in the McLuhan Salon.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:43.031" end="00:05:48.000">She was also the main person helping <br/>to organize this event</p>
            <p begin="00:05:48.322" end="00:05:51.508">together with Anja Meier who is behind <br/>the camera over there.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:51.789" end="00:05:54.221">Unfortunately, Andrea had an injury</p>
            <p begin="00:05:54.456" end="00:05:57.857">and so she can't be here this evening.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:58.918" end="00:06:02.960">Also a very big thank you, for all the <br/>other McLuhan events</p>
            <p begin="00:06:02.975" end="00:06:05.266">that we were doing this year,</p>
            <p begin="00:06:05.266" end="00:06:09.989">to Katharina Fischner over here, <br/>cultural attach&#233;e from the embassy</p>
            <p begin="00:06:10.101" end="00:06:15.016">because this is kind of our last <br/>real McLuhan event here this year.</p>
            <p begin="00:06:18.191" end="00:06:21.740">I just really wanted to give you guys <br/>also from the embassy a big thank you</p>
            <p begin="00:06:21.740" end="00:06:27.221">and also to St&#233;phane Charbonneau <br/>who is the -- not the attach&#233;,</p>
            <p begin="00:06:27.438" end="00:06:30.330">but the Counsellor for Cultural Affairs.</p>
            <p begin="00:06:30.577" end="00:06:37.485">He was also primarily responsible <br/>in getting funding together</p>
            <p begin="00:06:37.489" end="00:06:40.076">so that we could invite <br/>Graham Larkin here.</p>
            <p begin="00:06:40.076" end="00:06:43.158">So, Graham, again, it is a great pleasure <br/>to have you here</p>
            <p begin="00:06:43.718" end="00:06:46.123">and we are very much looking forward to</p>
            <p begin="00:06:47.469" end="00:06:48.703">seeing what you've been up to in the <br/>past few months.</p>
            <p begin="00:06:49.721" end="00:06:52.252">[Graham Larkin] <br/>Welcome! Microphone please</p>
            <p begin="00:06:52.252" end="00:06:54.211">[murmuring]</p>
            <p begin="00:06:54.211" end="00:06:55.223">Let's see if this works</p>
            <p begin="00:07:02.723" end="00:07:04.807">So...</p>
            <p begin="00:07:05.863" end="00:07:06.869">Lovely to be here. Thank you so much.</p>
            <p begin="00:07:08.152" end="00:07:11.713">Deep thanks really need to <br/>go out to Stephen Kovats</p>
            <p begin="00:07:12.224" end="00:07:13.830">You've named all the other names</p>
            <p begin="00:07:14.563" end="00:07:20.504">So I won't rethank Andrea Boegner <br/>and everyone else who's been so helpful</p>
            <p begin="00:07:20.504" end="00:07:24.595">But, really, hats off to you, Stephen,</p>
            <p begin="00:07:24.737" end="00:07:28.355">for your persistence <br/>and your kindness</p>
            <p begin="00:07:28.355" end="00:07:32.369">and just your effectiveness in making<br/>all thirty of these events</p>
            <p begin="00:07:32.369" end="00:07:34.374">and not forgetting me in the mix.</p>
            <p begin="00:07:35.720" end="00:07:37.586">I'm really grateful for that.</p>
            <p begin="00:07:37.810" end="00:07:41.443">It's a Herculean amount <br/>of effort for you</p>
            <p begin="00:07:43.793" end="00:07:46.527">and such a pleasure <br/>for me. So thank you.</p>
            <p begin="00:07:47.334" end="00:07:49.744">So, the McLuhan archive... </p>
            <p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:54.764">You said I was interested in the documents</p>
            <p begin="00:07:55.197" end="00:07:56.601">As opposed to the audiovisual stuff</p>
            <p begin="00:07:56.866" end="00:07:58.476">Well, for me it's sort of all one</p>
            <p begin="00:07:59.085" end="00:08:01.498">And really one of the things, <br/>I'm trying to do</p>
            <p begin="00:08:01.549" end="00:08:05.506">with my limited time and limited <br/>powerpointing abilities</p>
            <p begin="00:08:05.639" end="00:08:10.328">is give you a sense of <br/>the real range of material evidence,</p>
            <p begin="00:08:10.953" end="00:08:13.032">much of paper-based,</p>
            <p begin="00:08:13.449" end="00:08:17.620">much of it based in this gigantic archive <br/>of Library &amp; Archives Canada</p>
            <p begin="00:08:17.629" end="00:08:21.787">which has an estimated <br/>800,000 ... sheets of paper</p>
            <p begin="00:08:23.513" end="00:08:25.113">relating to McLuhan.</p>
            <p begin="00:08:25.455" end="00:08:27.818">And many of them, photocopies <br/>or articles or whatever</p>
            <p begin="00:08:27.881" end="00:08:30.456">but a lot of original stuff and <br/>manuscripts and typescripts</p>
            <p begin="00:08:30.594" end="00:08:36.649">and I'm going to try to give you a flavour <br/>of the variety and depth of that material.</p>
            <p begin="00:08:37.891" end="00:08:41.401">But I think I'll begin just by saying</p>
            <p begin="00:08:43.329" end="00:08:47.940"><span tts:fontStyle="italic">why</span> I'm doing what I'm doing <br/>with McLuhan.</p>
            <p begin="00:08:49.369" end="00:08:54.148">And it really has largely to do with</p>
            <p begin="00:08:55.085" end="00:08:56.641">my feeling that</p>
            <p begin="00:08:57.886" end="00:08:59.164">we tend to see McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:09:00.378" end="00:09:01.536">above all, I think as...</p>
            <p begin="00:09:02.316" end="00:09:03.852">We tend to put him in certain boxes.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:04.822" end="00:09:06.810">and we see him -- and rightly so.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:10.052">I mean, he really was an kind of <br/>initiator of discourses</p>
            <p begin="00:09:10.436" end="00:09:14.683">to use Foucault's phrase <br/>that he said about Marx and Freud.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:15.464" end="00:09:22.740">But --he really kind of invented, to an <br/>amazing extent, cultural studies</p>
            <p begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:27.076">with <span tts:fontStyle="italic">The Mechanical Bride</span>, the 1951 book, <br/>along with a few others.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:27.473" end="00:09:30.159">But that was really a big deal, <br/>especially in the English-speaking world.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:30.201" end="00:09:36.527">I mean we didn't know in the English <br/>speaking world about [Siegfried] Kracauer or [Walter] Benjamin</p>
            <p begin="00:09:36.884" end="00:09:40.819">or any of the people who were sort of <br/>doing what could become cultural studies.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:40.842" end="00:09:42.649">Those translations didn't happen till later.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:42.714" end="00:09:44.611">But it was really -- in the English speaking world</p>
            <p begin="00:09:44.767" end="00:09:47.687">it was really people here and there.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:47.850" end="00:09:50.378">There was Robert Warshaw <br/>or there was Gilbert Seldes, or whatever</p>
            <p begin="00:09:50.828" end="00:09:53.683">But it was really McLuhan who kind of <br/>wrote a book on it and brought it together</p>
            <p begin="00:09:54.017" end="00:09:57.595">with this book published in 1951.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:59.425" end="00:10:03.118">So, as with cultural studies, <br/>he also, of course</p>
            <p begin="00:10:03.605" end="00:10:09.831">is a hugely foundational figure <br/>for communication studies, as well.</p>
            <p begin="00:10:11.341" end="00:10:15.999">And in a way, <br/>probably to the greatest extent,</p>
            <p begin="00:10:16.200" end="00:10:20.809">he has been studied as a theorist</p>
            <p begin="00:10:22.773" end="00:10:27.154">in communication studies and that's <br/>a discipline that's --</p>
            <p begin="00:10:27.154" end="00:10:30.053"> I guess it's a discipline --<br/>that's alive and well.</p>
            <p begin="00:10:31.923" end="00:10:37.224">An interdisciplinary<br/>thing that's branching off into</p>
            <p begin="00:10:37.569" end="00:10:40.107">media ecology and all kinds of things.</p>
            <p begin="00:10:42.295" end="00:10:43.773">And my feeling is that </p>
            <p begin="00:10:44.006" end="00:10:45.473">this McLuhan that I'm saying </p>
            <p begin="00:10:45.678" end="00:10:50.097">has been taken care of, and <br/>really attended to, by scholars</p>
            <p begin="00:10:51.670" end="00:10:53.954">is the <span tts:fontStyle="italic">theorist.</span></p>
            <p begin="00:10:55.543" end="00:11:00.405">And I think that it's ironic</p>
            <p begin="00:11:01.870" end="00:11:06.635">how little has been done on <br/>the material aspects of his practice.</p>
            <p begin="00:11:07.708" end="00:11:11.544">given the fact that he felt: <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:11:11.544" end="00:11:14.194">"the medium is the message."</p>
            <p begin="00:11:14.274" end="00:11:18.718">And given the fact that he said:</p>
            <p begin="00:11:20.441" end="00:11:22.246">"I have percepts, not concepts."</p>
            <p begin="00:11:24.077" end="00:11:29.603">and said, that his -- correctly, in a way --<br/>that his probes and explorations</p>
            <p begin="00:11:30.642" end="00:11:34.941">didn't really add up to anything as <br/>rigorous as a theory.</p>
            <p begin="00:11:37.530" end="00:11:42.253">And so what I'm trying to do <br/>is sort of</p>
            <p begin="00:11:43.206" end="00:11:46.039">get with the program a little bit, <br/>after a hundred years</p>
            <p begin="00:11:46.420" end="00:11:49.149">and apply some of his own methods</p>
            <p begin="00:11:50.403" end="00:11:52.741">to his own work. That is: <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:11:52.741" end="00:11:56.061">to look at the media environment</p>
            <p begin="00:11:56.061" end="00:11:57.916">that he was embedded in </p>
            <p begin="00:11:57.956" end="00:11:59.860">and all of the traces of his own -- <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:11:59.860" end="00:12:02.360">what I call his <span tts:fontStyle="italic">media practice.</span></p>
            <p begin="00:12:02.360" end="00:12:07.227">And by that I mean <br/>not only his productions</p>
            <p begin="00:12:07.389" end="00:12:08.960">but also his receptions</p>
            <p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:11.032">and you'll see what I mean by that.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:11.032" end="00:12:12.265">But basically every... </p>
            <p begin="00:12:13.826" end="00:12:15.382">We're lucky that the archive is so rich</p>
            <p begin="00:12:15.420" end="00:12:17.315">it looks like he just threw nothing away</p>
            <p begin="00:12:17.341" end="00:12:18.947">So we basically have <br/>every piece of paper</p>
            <p begin="00:12:18.956" end="00:12:20.682">that passed through his hands <br/>and then some.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:22.416" end="00:12:26.037">And a lot of traces of his <br/>encounters with other media.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:27.870" end="00:12:33.197">Radio, film, TV and so on.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:34.110" end="00:12:36.584">So, that's really what <br/>I'm going to be unpacking for you.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:36.662" end="00:12:39.541">But as a way in... <br/>what I'm going to do is</p>
            <p begin="00:12:40.219" end="00:12:43.141">just start a slideshow here </p>
            <p begin="00:12:43.778" end="00:12:47.989">and maybe try to navigate this space <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:12:48.013" end="00:12:51.840">in a way that allows you to look <br/>at the images and at me.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:52.443" end="00:12:56.683">And give you a little bit of the story <br/>of how I came to McLuhan.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:56.953" end="00:12:59.319">Because in my day job, <br/>up until very recently,</p>
            <p begin="00:12:59.319" end="00:13:01.831">I was a curator of painting, sculpture <br/>and decorative arts. So, basically</p>
            <p begin="00:13:01.969" end="00:13:04.150">European &amp; American sculpture with art <br/>at the National Gallery of Canada.</p>
            <p begin="00:13:06.331" end="00:13:08.513">I was trained as an art historian. </p>
            <p begin="00:13:09.613" end="00:13:11.308">and really actually a historian in print</p>
            <p begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:15.466">And I'm going to go back now <br/>to a conference</p>
            <p begin="00:13:16.191" end="00:13:21.202">that I co-hosted in 1998 <br/>at Harvard University</p>
            <p begin="00:13:21.432" end="00:13:22.617">when I was a student there.</p>
            <p begin="00:13:22.976" end="00:13:25.428">doing my doctoral studies, called</p>

            <p begin="00:13:41.311" end="00:13:43.115">who were sort of leaning that way,</p>
            <p begin="00:13:43.137" end="00:13:45.864">towards a kind of materialistic <br/>take on things,</p>

            <p begin="00:14:01.856" end="00:14:06.330">And we published that in 2001 <br/>in the journal <span tts:fontStyle="italic">Word &amp; Image</span></p>
            <p begin="00:14:07.173" end="00:14:10.405">and I did mention</p>

            <p begin="00:14:58.987" end="00:15:00.593">So that was this particular moment.</p>
            <p begin="00:15:01.179" end="00:15:02.964">But now I think<br/>we're in a moment where</p>
            <p begin="00:15:03.277" end="00:15:05.283">we're seeing a lot of </p>

            <p begin="00:15:30.757" end="00:15:32.754">little things from people's <br/>personal collections</p>
            <p begin="00:15:33.740" end="00:15:37.157">that are opposed to </p>

            <p begin="00:15:42.809" end="00:15:44.371">So there's a bit of this going around.</p>

            <p begin="00:15:48.375" end="00:15:50.427">And then, after the conference</p>
            <p begin="00:15:50.427" end="00:15:52.987">I ended up writing a doctoral dissertation</p>

            <p begin="00:16:29.513" end="00:16:33.333">and of the function of the thing. </p>
            <p begin="00:16:34.180" end="00:16:38.168">And, perhaps, some indication that <br/>I'm not afraid to touch it.</p>
            <p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:45.542">You know, I think that too often <br/>when we look at media</p>
            <p begin="00:16:45.542" end="00:16:47.334">such as a printed book <br/>or a printed image</p>
            <p begin="00:16:47.334" end="00:16:49.238">things kind of get <span tts:fontStyle="italic">posterized.</span></p>
            <p begin="00:16:49.238" end="00:16:52.014">And you lose a sense of<br/>... the texture</p>
            <p begin="00:16:53.254" end="00:16:55.245">and, you know, the full tactility. </p>
            <p begin="00:16:57.507" end="00:17:02.187">And sort of intersensory fullness of <br/>these objects.</p>
            <p begin="00:17:02.550" end="00:17:06.508">And so you'll see a lot of my hand <br/>in the images to follow.</p>

            <p begin="00:17:13.286" end="00:17:15.432"> in my dissertation. <br/>But I think he's in there, in some other place.</p>
            <p begin="00:17:17.981" end="00:17:20.246">There's an example of these print albums</p>
            <p begin="00:17:20.408" end="00:17:22.936">that people were compiling at that time, and</p>
            <p begin="00:17:23.221" end="00:17:26.634">McLuhan himself wrote a <br/>doctoral dissertation</p>
            <p begin="00:17:26.822" end="00:17:31.840">on a 16thC compiler, named [Thomas] Nashe</p>
            <p begin="00:17:32.649" end="00:17:35.713">So I come, in a way, from where he</p>
            <p begin="00:17:37.434" end="00:17:40.074">pretty close to where he comes from.</p>
            <p begin="00:17:40.817" end="00:17:42.894">And I'm even into having quotations</p>
            <p begin="00:17:42.982" end="00:17:45.505">as he is as well. He uses a lot of those.</p>
            <p begin="00:17:45.944" end="00:17:48.106">And I'm not afraid, to use Steph[e]n's word, </p>
            <p begin="00:17:54.278" end="00:17:54.785">to have a kind of collage of text, <br/>as well as images.</p>
            <p begin="00:17:56.243" end="00:18:00.097">So, as I say, I was living in Ottawa</p>
            <p begin="00:18:02.555" end="00:18:05.471">And pretty much, down the street <br/>from where I worked at the National Gallery</p>
            <p begin="00:18:06.029" end="00:18:08.057">was Library and Archives Canada.</p>
            <p begin="00:18:10.223" end="00:18:14.234">And I was very excited about the possibility</p>
            <p begin="00:18:14.344" end="00:18:16.536">of doing something <br/>for the centenary of McLuhan.</p>
            <p begin="00:18:17.014" end="00:18:19.107">What I really wanted to do</p>
            <p begin="00:18:19.107" end="00:18:21.047">was to have an exhibition somewhere</p>
            <p begin="00:18:21.172" end="00:18:23.971">ideally at LAC<br/>(Library &amp; Archives Canada)</p>
            <p begin="00:18:24.287" end="00:18:26.578">That would bring together ...</p>
            <p begin="00:18:27.277" end="00:18:28.841">Well, I had this idea, <br/>that I'd bring together</p>
            <p begin="00:18:28.861" end="00:18:31.480">a hundred objects and call it <br/>'McLuhan Century'</p>
            <p begin="00:18:32.438" end="00:18:35.047">There would be, a kind of a, very </p>
            <p begin="00:18:36.146" end="00:18:38.770">thick description, <br/>a reading of each of these objects</p>
            <p begin="00:18:39.330" end="00:18:42.687">that shows how it exemplifies his <br/>engagements</p>
            <p begin="00:18:43.028" end="00:18:44.856">with various kinds of media.</p>
            <p begin="00:18:46.861" end="00:18:50.719">And here, we have a detail of <br/>the webpage</p>
            <p begin="00:18:51.177" end="00:18:52.555">you can go onto the LAC webpage</p>
            <p begin="00:18:52.570" end="00:18:55.388">you can get many hundreds of pages of</p>

            <p begin="00:18:57.800" end="00:18:58.995">You can see here summarized</p>
            <p begin="00:18:59.639" end="00:19:02.630">just what's in it. 43.6 metres<br/>of textual records.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:02.951" end="00:19:04.274">800,000 papers.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:05.195" end="00:19:06.523">That's shelf meters, as you know,</p>
            <p begin="00:19:08.310" end="00:19:10.058">and various other stuff</p>
            <p begin="00:19:10.058" end="00:19:12.910">including audio cassettes and <br/>audio discs and reels and films</p>
            <p begin="00:19:12.910" end="00:19:13.910">And some of these things are just stuff.<br/></p>
            <p begin="00:19:13.910" end="00:19:15.489">It's just the stuff he had.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:15.489" end="00:19:19.541">So it might not be directly <span tts:fontStyle="italic">him,</span><br/>right: so it's not necessarily all <span tts:fontStyle="italic">of</span> him.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:20.173" end="00:19:24.202">Just as all the papers aren't <br/>necessarily things written by him.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:24.456" end="00:19:27.543">But, it's all stuff <br/>that was from him</p>
            <p begin="00:19:27.543" end="00:19:30.703">and acquired and catalogued <br/>in the mid 80s.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:31.416" end="00:19:33.765">Once it was acquired.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:34.182" end="00:19:36.486">And there wasn't a lot of interest <br/>from Library &amp; Archives Canada.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:36.486" end="00:19:39.600">Well there really wasn't <br/>interest from them.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:41.593">So, I kept coming back to them</p>
            <p begin="00:19:41.593" end="00:19:46.839">and I came with my buddy <br/>Dominique Scheffel-Dunand who is in Toronto,</p>
            <p begin="00:19:46.839" end="00:19:48.632">and who did a wonderful <br/>McLuhan festival <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:19:48.632" end="00:19:52.452">that was really, along with Berlin, <br/>just the biggest</p>
            <p begin="00:19:52.452" end="00:19:54.700">McLuhan celebration this year, <br/>for the centenary.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:55.955" end="00:19:58.945">And we tried to get something <br/>going with them</p>
            <p begin="00:19:58.945" end="00:20:00.835">and the Science &amp; Tech Museum.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:00.835" end="00:20:02.589">Again, about McLuhan's...</p>
            <p begin="00:20:02.589" end="00:20:06.371">that would be an exhibition of <br/>McLuhan's engagements with media.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:06.740" end="00:20:11.613">I bumped into Robert Bean, <br/>a photographer, and</p>
            <p begin="00:20:11.677" end="00:20:13.357">told him about the archive </p>
            <p begin="00:20:13.373" end="00:20:15.927">and he really ran with it and <br/>has done a number of exhibitions.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:16.068" end="00:20:19.084">Now, we're actually looking, <br/>we're getting into the library now.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:19.300" end="00:20:21.111">For the moment here, the photographs</p>
            <p begin="00:20:21.206" end="00:20:25.584">taken by Robert Bean, <br/>when he went there with me</p>
            <p begin="00:20:25.831" end="00:20:26.827">over a year ago.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:27.103" end="00:20:31.181">I think it was around May of 2010 [...]</p>
            <p begin="00:20:31.181" end="00:20:33.835">So now we're in the reserve room.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:34.784" end="00:20:37.998">So we're getting closer to the material.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:38.432" end="00:20:39.663">And there we are. There I am.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:45.326">And there are the boxes <br/>from the McLuhan Archive</p>
            <p begin="00:20:45.326" end="00:20:46.732">which some of you may --</p>
            <p begin="00:20:46.732" end="00:20:49.991">Can we have a show hands? Has anyone<br/>actually been in the McLuhan Archive?</p>
            <p begin="00:20:50.655" end="00:20:51.846">Yeah, that's what I figured. </p>
            <p begin="00:20:51.873" end="00:20:54.061">I mean, in Canada, <br/>it's a rarity, even among --</p>
            <p begin="00:20:55.361" end="00:20:58.071">you know, there's many McLuhan scholars <br/>who haven't been in there.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:58.071" end="00:20:58.941">So, that's good. </p>
            <p begin="00:20:58.951" end="00:21:01.681">I mean this will be fresh for you.</p>
            <p begin="00:21:02.271" end="00:21:03.721">And here, you can see</p>
            <p begin="00:21:03.751" end="00:21:06.871">I'm looking at a scrapbook</p>
            <p begin="00:21:06.871" end="00:21:08.440">that was assembled in the 60s</p>
            <p begin="00:21:08.449" end="00:21:10.951">by McLuhan and, I suspect,</p>
            <p begin="00:21:11.071" end="00:21:15.302">Corinne, his wife, <br/>who did a lot of -- all the typing for him.</p>
            <p begin="00:21:15.303" end="00:21:18.303">And there I am, just, sort of</p>
            <p begin="00:21:19.580" end="00:21:22.536">like I say, not afraid <br/>to touch these things.</p>
            <p begin="00:21:23.435" end="00:21:26.544">Now, there's an exhibition hall. <br/>I went to LAC ...</p>
            <p begin="00:21:26.544" end="00:21:28.726">if you go pass Glenn Gould's piano <br/>which is a bit sad</p>
            <p begin="00:21:28.726" end="00:21:31.648">because its unused and under <br/>this funny quilted thing....</p>
            <p begin="00:21:31.648" end="00:21:33.091">then you get to this area here</p>
            <p begin="00:21:33.095" end="00:21:35.137">which is this exhibition room </p>
            <p begin="00:21:35.162" end="00:21:37.593">and there was an exhibition on there</p>
            <p begin="00:21:37.593" end="00:21:39.346">I remember when I went with Dominique</p>
            <p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:41.975">on Gabriel Roy, this Canadian author</p>
            <p begin="00:21:42.663" end="00:21:45.166">and we said: Well, can we have it</p>
            <p begin="00:21:45.446" end="00:21:48.700">for 2011, and do a McLuhan thing?</p>
            <p begin="00:21:48.843" end="00:21:50.717">And they said: <br/>"No, no, no, we're done."</p>
            <p begin="00:21:50.807" end="00:21:53.181">"We're not having <br/>any more exhibitions."</p>
            <p begin="00:21:53.181" end="00:21:54.976">"We're going digital now."</p>
            <p begin="00:21:55.111" end="00:21:58.111">So ...</p>
            <p begin="00:21:58.551" end="00:22:00.042">That's what it looks like now.</p>
            <p begin="00:22:00.231" end="00:22:02.592">There's nothing going on, anymore. </p>
            <p begin="00:22:04.673" end="00:22:07.176">And they've actually had to--<br/>they've cut 40 positions</p>
            <p begin="00:22:07.577" end="00:22:10.054">in the last three years.</p>
            <p begin="00:22:10.327" end="00:22:12.330">Just as we have at the <br/>National Gallery, including my own.</p>
            <p begin="00:22:14.420" end="00:22:17.792">And so it's a pretty rough time. <br/>And it's a major library...</p>
            <p begin="00:22:18.153" end="00:22:19.871">Most could of the list <br/>I can find on the web had is</p>
            <p begin="00:22:19.976" end="00:22:21.812">fourth biggest in the world</p>
            <p begin="00:22:23.303" end="00:22:26.223">That's the library not the -- this list --</p>
            <p begin="00:22:26.280" end="00:22:28.069">But I'm sure as archive as well</p>
            <p begin="00:22:28.241" end="00:22:29.566">it's substantial. And yet</p>
            <p begin="00:22:29.713" end="00:22:31.618">it's a bit sepulchral <br/>in there these days.</p>
            <p begin="00:22:31.823" end="00:22:35.842">It's a bit of a tomb.</p>
            <p begin="00:22:37.818" end="00:22:39.763">So, that's the background.</p>
            <p begin="00:22:40.675" end="00:22:42.462">And what I <span tts:fontStyle="italic">was</span> able to do</p>
            <p begin="00:22:43.362" end="00:22:45.096">in lieu of an exhibition is</p>
            <p begin="00:22:46.505" end="00:22:47.744">the talk you're about to see,</p>
            <p begin="00:22:47.842" end="00:22:48.831"> the study you're about to see</p>
            <p begin="00:22:49.252" end="00:22:54.089">which is really the first time <br/>I'm coming out in public </p>
            <p begin="00:22:54.801" end="00:23:00.748">with my exposition on <br/>McLuhan's engagements with media.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:00.922" end="00:23:02.066">And the way I've set it up</p>
            <p begin="00:23:02.561" end="00:23:03.592">is thematically</p>
            <p begin="00:23:04.656" end="00:23:07.168">and these themes are also <br/>pretty much chronological as well.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:08.169" end="00:23:14.360">That is: they reflect whatever stage of <br/>McLuhan's practice that he's at.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:14.937" end="00:23:16.107">And like all of us [...]</p>
            <p begin="00:23:19.050" end="00:23:20.741">yeah we're talking before we watch TV. I think.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:22.937">So we'll with orality.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:25.669" end="00:23:27.722">Now, orality is, you know,</p>
            <p begin="00:23:28.542" end="00:23:32.964">is something that was <br/>of great interest to McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:23:34.752" end="00:23:38.502">He really -- you know, <br/>he looked at speech as technology.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:38.555" end="00:23:40.440">He looked at writing <br/>as a technology.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:40.440" end="00:23:42.980">He always had this big picture. </p>
            <p begin="00:23:44.051" end="00:23:47.621">And in the studies in orality, </p>
            <p begin="00:23:47.621" end="00:23:50.621">of which there were many <br/>amazing ones in the 20th century</p>
            <p begin="00:23:50.621" end="00:23:54.228">his favourite <br/>and still my favourite, I think</p>
            <p begin="00:23:54.780" end="00:23:57.736">is Eric Havelock's 1963 <br/><span tts:fontStyle="italic">Preface to Plato</span></p>
            <p begin="00:23:57.925" end="00:24:00.303">which is an incredible book <br/>that talks about</p>
            <p begin="00:24:01.008" end="00:24:03.392">the rise of literacy </p>
            <p begin="00:24:05.505" end="00:24:07.353">and what it meant <br/>for Greek culture.</p>

            <p begin="00:24:16.136" end="00:24:20.364">by McLuhan's disciple/pupil</p>
            <p begin="00:24:21.033" end="00:24:22.921">-- who turns 100 next year by the way--</p>
            <p begin="00:24:23.042" end="00:24:24.653">and there's going to be some <br/>celebrations in St. Louis -- </p>
            <p begin="00:24:24.653" end="00:24:26.703">named Walter Ong.</p>
            <p begin="00:24:27.303" end="00:24:28.876">And he wrote a book,</p>
            <p begin="00:24:28.876" end="00:24:30.909">sadly published 2 years after <br/>McLuhan's death,</p>
            <p begin="00:24:30.909" end="00:24:32.712">so this is published in 1982,</p>
            <p begin="00:24:33.317" end="00:24:35.066">called <span tts:fontStyle="italic">Orality and Literacy.</span></p>
            <p begin="00:24:35.324" end="00:24:36.927">which is really the best <br/>introduction to that subject.</p>
            <p begin="00:24:37.234" end="00:24:39.376">It's a beautiful synopsis that </p>
            <p begin="00:24:40.088" end="00:24:43.512">coins the term <br/>"secondary orality"</p>
            <p begin="00:24:43.642" end="00:24:47.788">to talk about what happens <br/>when you're literate</p>
            <p begin="00:24:48.385" end="00:24:56.293">but you're still experiencing <br/>various aural situations.</p>
            <p begin="00:24:56.993" end="00:24:59.322">and so it's a kind of overlay.</p>
            <p begin="00:24:59.739" end="00:25:00.648">And so it's very good.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:00.762" end="00:25:03.993">It's a reminder that it's not that <br/>one thing just transplants another</p>
            <p begin="00:25:04.435" end="00:25:06.504">or fully succeeds another.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:06.504" end="00:25:09.331">Things get <span tts:fontStyle="italic">hybrid,</span><br/>as McLuhan would say.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:10.592" end="00:25:13.074">And now, we're going to go <br/>back to the first object</p>
            <p begin="00:25:13.715" end="00:25:15.501">I'm going to show you from the archive.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:16.506" end="00:25:22.353">And what it is, is evidence of <br/>McLuhan's pre-literate phase.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:22.733" end="00:25:24.668">And it's a letter from his grandma.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:26.512" end="00:25:27.523">That's just on this scrap of paper. <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:25:27.523" end="00:25:28.534">There's one side.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:28.534" end="00:25:29.546">And there's the other side.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:30.036" end="00:25:31.248">And it says: "Dear Marshall ..."</p>
            <p begin="00:25:31.248" end="00:25:32.705">So, we're now --</p>
            <p begin="00:25:33.205" end="00:25:34.933">he was born in 1911. </p>
            <p begin="00:25:35.203" end="00:25:38.443">So, we're maybe 1916. <br/>Something like that.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:39.227" end="00:25:41.922">And we can pin-point it a little bit</p>
            <p begin="00:25:42.283" end="00:25:43.668">As you'll see.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:43.702" end="00:25:45.511">"Dear Marshall, so far away..."</p>
            <p begin="00:25:50.609" end="00:25:52.220">"I would like..."</p>
            <p begin="00:25:53.831" end="00:25:55.442">-- Sorry, it's harder to read off here -- <br/>"I would like to see you so much</p>
            <p begin="00:25:55.442" end="00:25:57.070">but you are so far away. </p>
            <p begin="00:25:58.225" end="00:26:00.953">I hope to see you all some time<br/>in warm weather.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:01.937" end="00:26:05.534">We're having very cold, much colder <br/>weather here than last winter.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:06.751" end="00:26:09.391">And I'm glad, you're trying to study. <br/>Keep at it</p>
            <p begin="00:26:11.238" end="00:26:13.918">and you can soon learn to read and write.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:15.876" end="00:26:19.559">Then I know, you will write me a letter <br/>with your own dear hand."</p>
            <p begin="00:26:20.644" end="00:26:22.016">So, Marshall doesn't know how to write <br/>yet. Read or write yet.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:25.712" end="00:26:30.037">This is a scribbling -- <br/>almost certainly by the young Marshall</p>
            <p begin="00:26:31.569" end="00:26:34.773">on the back of a mimeograph</p>
            <p begin="00:26:35.495" end="00:26:36.882">that is dated from 1915.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:39.673" end="00:26:41.631">which is of great -- <br/>special interest of me</p>
            <p begin="00:26:41.631" end="00:26:46.088">because McLuhan became a real <br/>power user of mimeographs.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:46.403" end="00:26:49.113">By ca. 1950 / 51. </p>
            <p begin="00:26:49.486" end="00:26:54.001">He was really into self-publishing</p>
            <p begin="00:26:55.163" end="00:26:57.983">and in fact things that were <br/>in fact kind of proto-blogs.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:58.083" end="00:27:01.932">In 1951 the mimeograph <br/>was the way to do that.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:04.082" end="00:27:07.484">So now, we'll get to his literacy.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:08.434" end="00:27:09.950">And I want to emphasize </p>
            <p begin="00:27:10.750" end="00:27:13.514">the reception as much as the production</p>
            <p begin="00:27:14.338" end="00:27:15.716">of this media environment. </p>
            <p begin="00:27:18.922" end="00:27:23.079">So, here's a valentine to Marshall <br/>from a secret admirer</p>
            <p begin="00:27:24.941" end="00:27:27.553">that he doubtless received <br/>at a very young age.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:29.636" end="00:27:32.297">And here is Marshall<br/>practicing his cursive.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:32.736" end="00:27:34.683">So you can see "Marshall" <br/>at the top</p>
            <p begin="00:27:35.265" end="00:27:37.078">and then various <br/>writing exercises.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:37.078" end="00:27:38.421">And this is the sort of checkmark</p>
            <p begin="00:27:38.421" end="00:27:39.467">for the teacher to show</p>
            <p begin="00:27:39.467" end="00:27:45.500">that it's been properly <br/>surveyed by the teacher.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:46.194" end="00:27:48.303">And then just as <br/>a kind of example --</p>
            <p begin="00:27:48.455" end="00:27:52.025">because I don't need to convince you <br/>that he knew how to read and write --</p>
            <p begin="00:27:52.762" end="00:27:54.336">but I just want to give you a taste</p>
            <p begin="00:27:54.713" end="00:27:58.374">of the archive, by showing you <br/>this collection of cigar bands</p>
            <p begin="00:27:58.487" end="00:28:01.812">that were in a little book <br/>that Marshall owned.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:02.597" end="00:28:04.469">And I like it on many levels. </p>
            <p begin="00:28:04.479" end="00:28:06.009">But not least because</p>
            <p begin="00:28:06.668" end="00:28:09.082">it really shows <br/>text and image together.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:10.864" end="00:28:13.704">My thing, I guess, in some way. <br/>It kind of shows</p>
            <p begin="00:28:13.730" end="00:28:15.354">the inseparability of these things.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:16.050" end="00:28:19.794">It shows that print is often</p>
            <p begin="00:28:20.195" end="00:28:23.449">image, as well, as text, or image <br/>mixed in with text. It's complicated.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:27.201" end="00:28:28.986">-- Something went wrong with this slide --</p>
            <p begin="00:28:29.073" end="00:28:31.781">It's supposed to say <br/>'Listening and Watching'</p>
            <p begin="00:28:35.343" end="00:28:37.878">And so here we get to radio.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:39.849" end="00:28:41.879">And if I can go up here</p>
            <p begin="00:28:41.972" end="00:28:44.153">what I'm going to do is <br/>play you an audio clip</p>
            <p begin="00:28:44.567" end="00:28:45.802">which is from 1980 </p>
            <p begin="00:28:46.514" end="00:28:52.206">And it's [...] Marshall's younger brother <br/>Maurice McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:28:52.750" end="00:28:55.221">talking about the very young Marshall </p>
            <p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:28:57.827">and his crystal radio.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:58.975" end="00:29:00.683">So, let's see if this works. </p>
            <p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:09.491">Here we go.</p>
            <p begin="00:29:10.663" end="00:29:14.019"><span tts:fontStyle="italic">[Maurice's voice]</span> My recollection <br/>as we grew up as boys together</p>
            <p begin="00:29:14.468" end="00:29:16.576">was that Marshall <br/>had a keen interest in</p>
            <p begin="00:29:17.324" end="00:29:18.495">everything that was going on.</p>
            <p begin="00:29:19.169" end="00:29:21.683">Was it radio that was <br/>breaking at that time ...</p>
            <p begin="00:29:22.423" end="00:29:24.193">then he was the one who built</p>
            <p begin="00:29:24.882" end="00:29:26.356">a little crystal set.</p>
            <p begin="00:29:26.904" end="00:29:30.467">And we would go to sleep <br/>as kids in the same bed</p>
            <p begin="00:29:31.584" end="00:29:33.045">-- we didn't have separate <br/>rooms at that time --</p>
            <p begin="00:29:33.670" end="00:29:35.269">And we would <br/>divide the receivers.</p>
            <p begin="00:29:37.987" end="00:29:40.969">And we'd find a very good point in the <br/>crystal for a program. And we would</p>
            <p begin="00:29:40.969" end="00:29:45.224">fall asleep [chuckles] with the receiver <br/>on the pillow and our ear against it."</p>
            <p begin="00:29:45.224" end="00:29:47.344">[end of clip]</p>
            <p begin="00:29:47.914" end="00:29:50.675">So, that's Maurice sounding very <br/>much like Marshall --</p>
            <p begin="00:29:50.675" end="00:29:53.524">-- a spitting image of Marshall's voice --</p>
            <p begin="00:29:53.524" end="00:29:55.645">describing how -- I guess <br/>they would split up the headphones </p>
            <p begin="00:29:55.645" end="00:29:57.117">and each take an ear</p>
            <p begin="00:29:57.117" end="00:30:00.640">on this very primitive <br/>build-it-yourself radio</p>
            <p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:03.085">that they had, maybe ca. 1920.</p>
            <p begin="00:30:04.251" end="00:30:07.477">And now I'm just going <br/>to give you a quotation</p>
            <p begin="00:30:07.914" end="00:30:09.979">that's is in his letters.</p>
            <p begin="00:30:10.532" end="00:30:12.200">Where he says -- and now <br/>he's writing to his mother</p>

            <p begin="00:30:14.085" end="00:30:15.390">And this is a random quotation --</p>
            <p begin="00:30:15.390" end="00:30:16.938">it's just the kind of thing <br/>he says to his mother --</p>

            <p begin="00:31:29.508" end="00:31:30.729">And I certainly encourage you, <br/>to go up</p>
            <p begin="00:31:30.729" end="00:31:32.125">as some people <br/>are starting to do</p>
            <p begin="00:31:32.527" end="00:31:36.029">and go take a look <br/>at the nearest screen.</p>
            <p begin="00:31:37.304" end="00:31:39.646">And this one starts -- <br/>the first thing it says is: <span tts:fontStyle="italic">Flick.</span></p>
            <p begin="00:31:41.156" end="00:31:44.390">And that means he went to a movie, <br/>and it cost 1 --</p>
            <p begin="00:31:44.390" end="00:31:48.272">It's all in, I guess, shillings <br/>and pence here. So, <span tts:fontStyle="italic">flick.</span></p>
            <p begin="00:31:48.272" end="00:31:51.587">And we don't know what that was, because <br/>he doesn't say, but then he says:</p>
            <p begin="00:31:51.587" end="00:31:53.912">To see George Arliss <br/>as <span tts:fontStyle="italic">The Last Gentleman.</span></p>
            <p begin="00:31:53.912" end="00:31:56.238">And we know what that was.</p>
            <p begin="00:31:56.238" end="00:31:59.007">And that was this movie from 1935.</p>
            <p begin="00:31:59.858" end="00:32:03.277">And then he says: To see <span tts:fontStyle="italic">Mrs. Wiggs <br/>of the Cabbage Patch</span> down here.</p>
            <p begin="00:32:03.418" end="00:32:04.459">And we know what that was.</p>
            <p begin="00:32:04.462" end="00:32:08.364">That was this W.C. Fields movie <br/>from the same year.</p>
            <p begin="00:32:08.970" end="00:32:10.726">And then, he also has <br/>various books he's --</p>
            <p begin="00:32:10.888" end="00:32:12.326"><span tts:fontStyle="italic">Dream of John Ball</span></p>
            <p begin="00:32:13.764" end="00:32:15.204">is a book by William Morris. <br/>And so on.</p>
            <p begin="00:32:16.167" end="00:32:18.339">So, we really know exactly </p>
            <p begin="00:32:19.101" end="00:32:20.414">what he's doing.</p>
            <p begin="00:32:20.467" end="00:32:23.790">Here's another reference. It just says: <br/>"Mickey Mouse bill at the Cosmopolitan."</p>
            <p begin="00:32:24.419" end="00:32:26.683">That's the movie theatre, <br/>and we know what he paid for it.</p>
            <p begin="00:32:26.683" end="00:32:29.807">We don't know what that was. <br/>At least not from this source alone.</p>
            <p begin="00:32:30.867" end="00:32:32.272"><span tts:fontStyle="italic">Flick</span> (movie): <span tts:fontStyle="italic">La Maternelle</span></p>
            <p begin="00:32:33.518" end="00:32:35.364">We know what that was, <br/>because that came out that year.</p>
            <p begin="00:32:35.664" end="00:32:37.536">So, one can actually go</p>
            <p begin="00:32:37.536" end="00:32:39.972">and reconstruct <br/>with great exactitude</p>
            <p begin="00:32:40.738" end="00:32:44.605">exactly which movies <br/>Marshall was looking at</p>
            <p begin="00:32:44.768" end="00:32:47.328">and which radio he was listening to, <br/>and so on, at a given time.</p>
            <p begin="00:32:47.328" end="00:32:49.844">And I think it's terribly important</p>
            <p begin="00:32:51.748" end="00:32:53.822">for the following reason:</p>
            <p begin="00:32:56.694" end="00:32:59.247">I'm kind of a McLuhan skeptic <br/>in many ways</p>
            <p begin="00:32:59.247" end="00:33:01.860">and one of the things <br/>I felt about his theories</p>
            <p begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:06.660">was that there weren't necessarily <br/>as well researched as they should be.</p>
            <p begin="00:33:07.400" end="00:33:08.834">You know -- they're a little bit --</p>
            <p begin="00:33:09.378" end="00:33:10.799">a book like <span tts:fontStyle="italic">Understanding Media</span></p>
            <p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:13.226">is almost biting off <br/>more than he can chew.</p>
            <p begin="00:33:13.226" end="00:33:15.696">I mean, how can you <br/>possibly know <span tts:fontStyle="italic">really</span></p>
            <p begin="00:33:15.696" end="00:33:16.958">about all this media. Come on!</p>
            <p begin="00:33:17.278" end="00:33:19.297">I mean I knew it was <br/>a very important synthesis</p>
            <p begin="00:33:19.728" end="00:33:21.484">-- a brilliantly useful book --</p>
            <p begin="00:33:21.605" end="00:33:24.500">But I also though: well. <br/>how well researched can this be?</p>
            <p begin="00:33:25.454" end="00:33:26.833">But when you think about it,</p>
            <p begin="00:33:29.301" end="00:33:32.106">we all have deep experience <br/>with all kinds of media </p>
            <p begin="00:33:32.692" end="00:33:33.755">throughout our lives.</p>
            <p begin="00:33:33.755" end="00:33:35.141">And I think it was <br/>his life experience</p>
            <p begin="00:33:35.141" end="00:33:37.485">that really gave McLuhan <br/>that kind of expertise</p>
            <p begin="00:33:37.855" end="00:33:38.951">in combination with the fact</p>
            <p begin="00:33:38.951" end="00:33:39.911">that he was paying attention.</p>
            <p begin="00:33:39.911" end="00:33:41.924">He was, as he used to say,</p>
            <p begin="00:33:41.924" end="00:33:45.206">the fish that was <br/>paying attention to the water.</p>
            <p begin="00:33:46.874" end="00:33:49.012">So in looking at these details, <br/>I've come to think:</p>
            <p begin="00:33:51.150" end="00:33:53.290">Well, sure, of course he <br/>knew what a movie was.</p>
            <p begin="00:33:56.376" end="00:33:59.372">Another example: [...]</p>
            <p begin="00:33:59.372" end="00:34:02.368"><span tts:fontStyle="italic">Viva Villa</span>, this movie about <br/>the Mexican revolution.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:02.368" end="00:34:05.366">"was a stirring picture excellently <br/>produced" and so on.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:05.461" end="00:34:07.856">I mean, there's <span tts:fontStyle="italic">tons</span> <br/>of this evidence.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:08.718" end="00:34:11.107">And then, of course, <br/>I show this view of his office</p>
            <p begin="00:34:11.107" end="00:34:11.897">just because it has a TV in it.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:11.897" end="00:34:13.660">And I don't need to remind you <br/>of the fact</p>
            <p begin="00:34:13.660" end="00:34:19.870">that he commented a lot on TV <br/>and how it supplanted film.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:20.914" end="00:34:22.480">There's something funny <br/>about all these headers --</p>
            <p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:24.312">I think we're just seeing <br/>very partial views.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:25.690" end="00:34:27.449">Maybe it's just the font <br/>that's going funny.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:28.634" end="00:34:30.229">This next section is called:</p>
            <p begin="00:34:30.269" end="00:34:31.773"><span tts:fontStyle="italic">Being a Character.</span></p>
            <p begin="00:34:31.792" end="00:34:34.441">As I say, these are kind of thematic <br/>and kind of chronological.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:34.764" end="00:34:36.044">And what I'm interested in</p>
            <p begin="00:34:36.104" end="00:34:37.488">in this little section</p>
            <p begin="00:34:37.528" end="00:34:39.259">is really talking about </p>
            <p begin="00:34:39.989" end="00:34:42.398">McLuhan's interest in rhetoric.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:43.453" end="00:34:46.566">And, not least, in the performative <br/>aspects of the <span tts:fontStyle="italic">rhetor.</span></p>
            <p begin="00:34:50.514" end="00:34:52.075">Of which his mother was one.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:55.049">And as you may know</p>
            <p begin="00:34:55.049" end="00:34:59.502">Elsie McLuhan was a -- <br/>what was called an elocutionist</p>
            <p begin="00:35:00.121" end="00:35:03.130">or, as we see here, a <br/>"reader and impersonator"</p>
            <p begin="00:35:03.759" end="00:35:09.595">which, in the pre-cinema age, was a way <br/>you got your kicks -- was going out</p>
            <p begin="00:35:09.677" end="00:35:12.288">and seeing these kind of <br/>vaudeville-type shows.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:12.486" end="00:35:15.164">of various types.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:16.187" end="00:35:18.476">That would sometimes consist of <br/>people getting up on a stage and</p>
            <p begin="00:35:18.476" end="00:35:19.750">giving recitations.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:20.770" end="00:35:26.638">Original or else straight adaptations or</p>
            <p begin="00:35:26.638" end="00:35:28.843">recitations of -- anything, really.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:29.545" end="00:35:30.740">High and low.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:30.740" end="00:35:32.506">And that's what his mother --</p>
            <p begin="00:35:32.506" end="00:35:34.303">the very mother <br/>to whom he was writing</p>
            <p begin="00:35:34.385" end="00:35:38.076">with such alacrity about<br/>whatever latest movie he'd seen</p>
            <p begin="00:35:38.271" end="00:35:40.754">-- that's what she did <br/>for a living back in Canada.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:41.761" end="00:35:44.082">And there's her picture, in a detail</p>
            <p begin="00:35:44.225" end="00:35:45.773">of that same photo <br/>that had the TV in it.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:47.494" end="00:35:51.246">And she's very, very <br/>important to Marshall.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:51.433" end="00:35:53.338">Much more so than his father.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:55.083" end="00:35:56.512">And now I'm going to show you</p>
            <p begin="00:35:56.809" end="00:36:00.107">a document from 1933</p>
            <p begin="00:36:01.048" end="00:36:08.875">which is the brochure that is the <br/>commemoration of the graduation,</p>
            <p begin="00:36:08.888" end="00:36:17.679">Marshall's graduation in 1933 <br/>from his M.A. at University of Manitoba</p>
            <p begin="00:36:18.095" end="00:36:20.345">And, what's interesting is that -- </p>
            <p begin="00:36:20.345" end="00:36:22.920">of course they've got valedictory addresses, <br/>and so on --</p>
            <p begin="00:36:22.920" end="00:36:24.599">but what's interesting is how McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:36:24.982" end="00:36:26.423">makes these notes. </p>
            <p begin="00:36:26.551" end="00:36:29.250">So, I guess, this is <br/>Professor H.N. Fieldhouse <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:36:29.250" end="00:36:31.350">"who talked about cheese."</p>
            <p begin="00:36:31.350" end="00:36:33.862">And this other --, <br/>I'm not sure which one of these</p>
            <p begin="00:36:33.862" end="00:36:35.930">-- whether it was John Thomson <br/>or Thelma Wright --</p>
            <p begin="00:36:36.876" end="00:36:39.986">"who showed the advantages <br/>of Miss Mitchell's training."</p>
            <p begin="00:36:40.361" end="00:36:44.142">Maybe this is someone <br/>who was training kids in rhetoric.</p>
            <p begin="00:36:44.469" end="00:36:46.621">And then on the back -- he doesn't stop</p>
            <p begin="00:36:46.638" end="00:36:49.142">he then goes, on the back -- <br/>the whole thing is covered --</p>
            <p begin="00:36:49.436" end="00:36:52.219">and he just goes on and on, <br/>in great detail</p>
            <p begin="00:36:52.247" end="00:36:55.108">in this sort of assessment <br/>of these performances</p>
            <p begin="00:36:55.108" end="00:36:56.838">often rather catty.</p>
            <p begin="00:36:57.108" end="00:37:01.407">You know: "Black spoke <br/>in puerile polysyllables</p>
            <p begin="00:37:01.407" end="00:37:07.770">of the Osbornean variety <span tts:fontStyle="italic">sans</span> the <br/>Osbornean imperiosity." (or something)</p>
            <p begin="00:37:07.770" end="00:37:10.770">Etc., etc., so he really goes</p>
            <p begin="00:37:10.770" end="00:37:15.626">into great detail in these analyses <br/>of people's rhetorical skills.</p>
            <p begin="00:37:17.971" end="00:37:19.712">And here he is again! Next year.</p>
            <p begin="00:37:19.769" end="00:37:26.337">Now, we're in Cambridge. <br/>In the fall term of '34.</p>
            <p begin="00:37:26.337" end="00:37:28.634">when he started at the <br/>University of Cambridge, in England.</p>
            <p begin="00:37:29.305" end="00:37:32.886">And sure enough, he's going to debates <br/>and annoting heavily</p>
            <p begin="00:37:34.031" end="00:37:41.625">So, Mr. Alport was "business-like, <br/>monotone, patting Britain on the back."</p>
            <p begin="00:37:43.330" end="00:37:47.416">Mr. I.M.C. Braby <br/>was "frightfully confident."</p>

            <p begin="00:37:51.085" end="00:37:53.501">Mr. A. Duff Cooper was "fiery" - <br/>and you know, etc.</p>
            <p begin="00:37:55.398" end="00:38:03.054">So -- he was very -- <br/>quite deep into this aspect of orality.</p>
            <p begin="00:38:04.565" end="00:38:07.810">The performative aspect <br/>of public speaking.</p>
            <p begin="00:38:08.876" end="00:38:09.805">And now what I'm showing you</p>
            <p begin="00:38:10.451" end="00:38:12.887">is a book called <br/><span tts:fontStyle="italic">A Character Anthology.</span></p>

            <p begin="00:38:45.499" end="00:38:46.961">Well it's complicated.</p>
            <p begin="00:38:47.078" end="00:38:49.140">There was a 17th century --</p>
            <p begin="00:38:49.683" end="00:38:52.294">In the early 17th century, <br/>throughout much of Europe</p>
            <p begin="00:38:52.513" end="00:38:54.727">it was common to have these <br/>books of characters</p>
            <p begin="00:38:54.727" end="00:38:56.458">that were based on <br/>this ancient writer</p>
            <p begin="00:38:56.908" end="00:39:00.075">in the tradition of this ancient writer <br/>named Theophrastus -- anyway --</p>
            <p begin="00:39:00.077" end="00:39:02.280">So, here it is. He's doing <br/>this kind of a retro thing.</p>
            <p begin="00:39:02.592" end="00:39:04.492">17th century thing <br/>in the 1930s.</p>
            <p begin="00:39:04.785" end="00:39:06.996">And he thought, wouldn't it be <br/>instructive and amusing</p>
            <p begin="00:39:07.451" end="00:39:10.167">to have -- in this case -- </p>
            <p begin="00:39:11.467" end="00:39:13.167">as far as I can tell --</p>
            <p begin="00:39:13.167" end="00:39:14.857">the characters are actually <br/>these writers</p>
            <p begin="00:39:14.857" end="00:39:16.683">and really what he's <br/>trying to do I think is</p>
            <p begin="00:39:16.683" end="00:39:18.992">give a sense of <br/>particular writing styles</p>
            <p begin="00:39:19.433" end="00:39:22.029">through making it into <br/>these characters.</p>
            <p begin="00:39:22.029" end="00:39:23.750">But that's what -- you'll remember-- <br/>his <br/>mother did.</p>
            <p begin="00:39:23.750" end="00:39:24.796">That's what she did:</p>
            <p begin="00:39:24.796" end="00:39:26.973">she was a character. I can't remember <br/>how they phrased it</p>

            <p begin="00:40:48.223" end="00:40:49.822">Then we have manuscripts --</p>

            <p begin="00:40:53.631" end="00:40:55.016">We have typescripts.</p>

            <p begin="00:40:59.121" end="00:41:00.768">we sometimes have even <br/>the original files that he had.</p>
            <p begin="00:41:00.768" end="00:41:02.415">If there was something</p>

            <p begin="00:41:17.433" end="00:41:20.513">This one was in what <br/>became the book in the end.</p>
            <p begin="00:41:20.513" end="00:41:21.823">And this one is called <br/>'Beautiful Bodies'</p>
            <p begin="00:41:21.903" end="00:41:23.160">I think it made it into the book.</p>
            <p begin="00:41:23.160" end="00:41:25.449">It's hard to keep track <br/>after seeing all these</p>

            <p begin="00:41:32.091" end="00:41:35.713">This 'Beautiful Bodies' <br/>was about a</p>
            <p begin="00:41:36.338" end="00:41:39.946">kind of pin-up advertisement <br/>for a funeral home</p>
            <p begin="00:41:40.513" end="00:41:42.186">which greatly amused him.</p>
            <p begin="00:41:42.343" end="00:41:44.182">And so he thought: <br/>I gotta write about this.</p>

            <p begin="00:41:50.946" end="00:41:52.157">Here's another one</p>

            <p begin="00:41:54.371" end="00:41:56.035">"Hygiene" and then <br/>had the snappier title</p>

            <p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:41:59.949">And that's all about <br/>various hygiene products</p>
            <p begin="00:41:59.949" end="00:42:02.905">like deodorants</p>
            <p begin="00:42:03.874" end="00:42:06.082">or tooth paste <br/>or mouth wash.</p>

            <p begin="00:42:15.901" end="00:42:18.708">And his son Eric tells me that <br/>the images in that book</p>
            <p begin="00:42:19.197" end="00:42:22.405">were actually made from slides </p>

            <p begin="00:42:24.906" end="00:42:27.550">started out as a kind of <br/>travelling slide lecture</p>
            <p begin="00:42:27.752" end="00:42:28.907">which is very interesting.</p>
            <p begin="00:42:30.658" end="00:42:32.914">So they're actually quite <br/>faded and beat up</p>
            <p begin="00:42:33.177" end="00:42:34.887">by the time they became these </p>
            <p begin="00:42:35.515" end="00:42:40.990">rather grungy illustrations <br/>for <span tts:fontStyle="italic">The Mechanical Bride.</span></p>

            <p begin="00:53:04.544" end="00:53:05.836">-- this is actually a student survey</p>

            <p begin="00:53:08.728" end="00:53:10.678">Here it is tabulated.</p>

            <p begin="00:53:39.261" end="00:53:41.057">And here is the uncorrected proof </p>

            <p begin="00:53:55.341" end="00:53:56.848">it does what <span tts:fontStyle="italic">Understanding Media</span> does.</p>
            <p begin="00:53:56.848" end="00:54:00.171">the 1960 book that takes each</p>

            <p begin="00:54:05.323" end="00:54:06.725">In this case, <br/>in kind of drier prose.</p>
            <p begin="00:54:07.051" end="00:54:10.594">The same thing that happened in <br/><span tts:fontStyle="italic">The Mechanical Bride</span>:</p>

            <p begin="00:55:50.089" end="00:55:55.073">And he put together Marshall McLuhan <br/>and the designer Quentin Fiore</p>

            <p begin="00:56:12.488" end="00:56:17.029">And I would recommend it. <br/>And also Carl Sagan and others.</p>

            <p begin="01:01:00.003" end="01:01:01.538">-- and then you get to <br/>something very dry</p>
            <p begin="01:01:01.955" end="01:01:07.855">you get to things that look very sort of <br/>scientific and serious and not so punchy</p>
            <p begin="01:01:07.855" end="01:01:09.083">There's the same charts</p>

            <p begin="01:01:36.163" end="01:01:40.731">a lot of these kind of aleatory</p>

            <p begin="01:01:52.367" end="01:01:54.277">I mean, some kind of <br/>scientific thing, I guess.</p>

            <p begin="01:02:20.780" end="01:02:22.217">This one looks like a tax form.</p>
            <p begin="01:02:22.425" end="01:02:23.343">You have to see the original</p>
            <p begin="01:02:23.586" end="01:02:25.648">because it's in <br/>this kind of newsprint</p>
            <p begin="01:02:26.007" end="01:02:27.208">It feels like a U.S. tax form.</p>
            <p begin="01:02:27.821" end="01:02:29.851">It's playing on John Milton <br/>and Spiro Agnew</p>

            <p begin="01:02:35.473" end="01:02:37.083">And this is the most <br/>unprepossessing one</p>
            <p begin="01:02:37.582" end="01:02:38.621">At least on the title page. </p>
            <p begin="01:02:38.895" end="01:02:40.383">It's a horrible mimeograph</p>
            <p begin="01:02:40.574" end="01:02:41.637">which I guess, <br/>it's this sort of --</p>
            <p begin="01:02:41.817" end="01:02:42.946">-- maybe <span tts:fontStyle="italic">that's it</span>.</p>
            <p begin="01:02:43.167" end="01:02:44.402">I think this is actually the original</p>
            <p begin="01:02:44.857" end="01:02:48.400">And it's deliberately <br/>looking sort of grungy</p>
            <p begin="01:02:49.591" end="01:02:50.478">and low-tech.</p>
            <p begin="01:02:51.842" end="01:02:54.604">And what it is -- is a 1970 interview </p>

            <p begin="01:03:32.670" end="01:03:34.456">This looks to me like <br/>a kind of 50s thing.</p>
            <p begin="01:03:34.964" end="01:03:36.463">Now they're getting retro </p>
