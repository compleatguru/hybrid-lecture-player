            <p begin="00:00:03.436" end="00:00:05.748">So, ladies and gentleman. <br/>Let's take a seat.<br/></p>
            <p begin="00:00:05.748" end="00:00:07.303">We will be starting shortly.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:18.872" end="00:00:22.610">So first of all Bonjour and Welcome in <br/>the Canadian Embassy in Germany</p>
            <p begin="00:00:22.866" end="00:00:25.099">Herzlich Willkommen in der <br/>KanadischenBotschaft in Berlin [German]</p>
            <p begin="00:00:25.384" end="00:00:26.468">Welcome to the Canadian Embassy</p>
            <p begin="00:00:26.690" end="00:00:29.885">Specifically in the Marshall McLuhan <br/>Salon here in the Embassy.</p>
            <p begin="00:00:30.125" end="00:00:32.401">We're happy to have you here tonight</p>
            <p begin="00:00:32.401" end="00:00:36.265">I have the great pleasure of introducing <br/>or welcome you all </p>
            <p begin="00:00:36.265" end="00:00:37.095">here to our salon<br/></p>
            <p begin="00:00:37.095" end="00:00:42.405">which has the largest McLuhan archive in <br/>Europe, something we're very proud of</p>
            <p begin="00:00:42.405" end="00:00:44.517">I'm not gonna say a whole lot</p>
            <p begin="00:00:44.517" end="00:00:47.479">I will pass the torch on to Stephen Kovats</p>
            <p begin="00:00:47.929" end="00:00:50.753">who is another great Canadian</p>
            <p begin="00:00:51.193" end="00:00:52.828">working and living here in Berlin</p>
            <p begin="00:00:53.007" end="00:00:56.974">and someone we have been working with <br/>very closely in the last couple of years</p>
            <p begin="00:00:57.206" end="00:01:01.975">And he is the initiator <br/>and director of the McLuhan in Europe</p>
            <p begin="00:01:03.006" end="00:01:05.314">Of course this is the centennial year <br/>as we know</p>
            <p begin="00:01:06.516" end="00:01:11.697">And this is 1 of 30 events that is taking <br/>place in throughout Europe about McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:01:11.731" end="00:01:16.242">We are very, very happy to have Stephen <br/>and of course Graham with us here today</p>
            <p begin="00:01:16.508" end="00:01:20.686">So I will all see you tomorrow <br/>I will pass this on now to Stephen Kovats</p>
            <p begin="00:01:20.686" end="00:01:24.740">to say now a little bit about Mr. Larkin <br/>Thank you.</p>
            <p begin="00:01:25.341" end="00:01:27.872">OK. Thank you very much, Sarah, and also</p>
            <p begin="00:01:28.690" end="00:01:32.377">Welcome to everybody who made it <br/>this afternoon!</p>
            <p begin="00:01:32.736" end="00:01:38.645">It's not quite evening yet <br/>even though it's getting dark already</p>
            <p begin="00:01:40.397" end="00:01:46.657">I just want to make a little brief, <br/>I guess, pre-intro because</p>
            <p begin="00:01:47.236" end="00:01:49.010"><br/>having Graham Larkin here</p>
            <p begin="00:01:50.016" end="00:01:53.490">other the fact that it's a great honor <br/>and pleasure to have you here</p>
            <p begin="00:01:54.193" end="00:01:58.820">he's actually the last speaker <br/>of our Re-Touching McLuhan conference</p>
            <p begin="00:01:59.422" end="00:02:02.751">which took place at the end of May <br/>earlier this year (2011)</p>
            <p begin="00:02:03.410" end="00:02:07.311">And so the pamphlets <br/>which are sitting out here</p>
            <p begin="00:02:07.598" end="00:02:10.337">which are labelled 27th-29th of May </p>
            <p begin="00:02:10.622" end="00:02:14.694">are actually still valid for this evening</p>
            <p begin="00:02:15.144" end="00:02:17.874">they work also for today</p>
            <p begin="00:02:18.096" end="00:02:20.722">Unfortunately, Graham Larkin <br/>wasn't able to make it</p>
            <p begin="00:02:21.075" end="00:02:23.596">at the last minute to the conference, <br/>then.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:25.136" end="00:02:28.416">And it's fantastic that we were able <br/>to get him today</p>
            <p begin="00:02:29.466" end="00:02:32.069">to give his lecture</p>
            <p begin="00:02:32.579" end="00:02:35.820">and in doing so, <br/>he's got the opportunity now</p>
            <p begin="00:02:36.122" end="00:02:40.261">which wasn't really possible <br/>in the context of the original conference </p>
            <p begin="00:02:40.646" end="00:02:44.411">to do a much broader lecture <br/>about his work.</p>
            <p begin="00:02:46.884" end="00:02:50.209">Graham Larkin is an art historian</p>
            <p begin="00:02:50.592" end="00:02:53.452">He is a McLuhan scholar and researcher</p>
            <p begin="00:02:55.025" end="00:02:58.334">We first met in the summer of last year</p>
            <p begin="00:02:58.917" end="00:03:05.685">when we were researching, preparing for <br/>McLuhan events here in Berlin and Europe</p>
            <p begin="00:03:06.367" end="00:03:10.732">Graham is doing some <br/>really amazing research</p>
            <p begin="00:03:11.177" end="00:03:15.325">into the physical archives <br/>of McLuhan's work</p>
            <p begin="00:03:15.705" end="00:03:18.816">so, what the McLuhan Salon here has</p>
            <p begin="00:03:19.204" end="00:03:24.369">is a fantastic selection of the <br/>audiovisual material from McLuhan's</p>
            <p begin="00:03:24.659" end="00:03:26.924">McLuhan broadcast material</p>
            <p begin="00:03:27.262" end="00:03:30.207">But the actual documents, <br/>the physical stuff...</p>
            <p begin="00:03:30.207" end="00:03:33.426">the writings and particularly the collages<br/></p>
            <p begin="00:03:33.901" end="00:03:38.624">and other sort of handmade artifacts of <br/>McLuhan of a</p>
            <p begin="00:03:38.953" end="00:03:44.734">large part are sitting in the national <br/>archives of Canada and in other places.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:45.023" end="00:03:52.420">and this is primarily where <br/>Graham Larkin is doing his research.</p>
            <p begin="00:03:52.970" end="00:03:58.216">And the conference, <br/>that we ran back in May</p>
            <p begin="00:03:58.216" end="00:04:02.230">which was curated by Dieter Daniels <br/>who is also here this evening.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:02.351" end="00:04:04.792">So, Dieter, great that you could make it!</p>
            <p begin="00:04:04.792" end="00:04:08.313">And Martina Leeker, who was also <br/>one of the speakers of the conference.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:08.313" end="00:04:10.536">it's nice to have you two as well here</p>
            <p begin="00:04:18.624" end="00:04:22.379">... is dealing primarily <br/>with tactility and media</p>
            <p begin="00:04:22.826" end="00:04:27.067">and how this is seen in McLuhan's work</p>
            <p begin="00:04:27.145" end="00:04:30.635">and how it relates to <br/>digital practice today.</p>
            <p begin="00:04:32.664" end="00:04:36.174">I'd also like to very briefly point out,</p>
            <p begin="00:04:36.224" end="00:04:41.989">welcome and introduce Baruch Gottlieb, <br/>back there in the red sweater</p>
            <p begin="00:04:42.500" end="00:04:46.021">and Steffi Winkler over here in the back</p>
            <p begin="00:04:46.058" end="00:04:49.798">because together with Steffi and Baruch</p>
            <p begin="00:04:49.798" end="00:04:52.380">we've been doing other <br/>McLuhan's centennial events this year</p>
            <p begin="00:04:52.405" end="00:04:55.305">primarily McLuminations, screenings...</p>
            <p begin="00:04:55.305" end="00:04:58.417">some of you, I think, <br/>have been to those as well</p>
            <p begin="00:04:58.429" end="00:05:02.990">where they put together with <br/>special guests.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:03.467" end="00:05:06.045">Last one we did with Martina Leeker</p>
            <p begin="00:05:06.782" end="00:05:09.908">where material from the broadcast archives </p>
            <p begin="00:05:10.002" end="00:05:15.505">are taken out, presented, commented, <br/>deconstructed, reconstructed</p>
            <p begin="00:05:17.588" end="00:05:21.412">We've had our official last <br/>"McLuminations" of the year</p>
            <p begin="00:05:21.442" end="00:05:22.781">a couple of weeks ago</p>
            <p begin="00:05:22.781" end="00:05:25.359">But I'm hoping they will be able to do <br/>some more of them</p>
            <p begin="00:05:25.359" end="00:05:29.256">even though if it's not <br/>the centennial year any more</p>
            <p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:32.817">I also like to give a quick thank you</p>
            <p begin="00:05:33.144" end="00:05:35.675">to Andrea Boegner</p>
            <p begin="00:05:35.876" end="00:05:42.543">Andrea works together with Sarah on <br/>programming here in the McLuhan Salon</p>
            <p begin="00:05:43.031" end="00:05:48.000">She was also the main person helping <br/>to organize this event</p>
            <p begin="00:05:48.322" end="00:05:51.508">together with Anja Meier who is behind <br/>the camera over there</p>
            <p begin="00:05:51.789" end="00:05:54.221">Unfortunately, Andrea had an injury</p>
            <p begin="00:05:54.456" end="00:05:57.857">so she can't be here this evening.</p>
            <p begin="00:05:58.918" end="00:06:02.960">Also a very big thank you, for all the <br/>other McLuhan events</p>
            <p begin="00:06:02.975" end="00:06:05.266">that we were doing this year.</p>
            <p begin="00:06:05.266" end="00:06:09.989">To Katharina Fischner over here, <br/>cultural attach&#233;e from the embassy</p>
            <p begin="00:06:10.101" end="00:06:15.016">because this is kind of our last <br/>real McLuhan event here this year.</p>
            <p begin="00:06:18.191" end="00:06:21.740">I just really wanted to give you guys <br/>also from the embassy a big thank you</p>
            <p begin="00:06:21.740" end="00:06:27.221">and also to St&#233;phane Charbonneau who is <br/>the, not the attach&#233;</p>
            <p begin="00:06:27.438" end="00:06:30.330">but the counselor for cultural affairs</p>
            <p begin="00:06:30.967" end="00:06:37.485">he was also primarily responsible in <br/>getting funding together</p>
            <p begin="00:06:37.489" end="00:06:40.076">so that we could invite Graham Larkin here</p>
            <p begin="00:06:40.076" end="00:06:43.158">So, Graham, again, it is a great pleasure <br/>to have you here</p>
            <p begin="00:06:43.718" end="00:06:46.123">and we are very much looking forward to</p>
            <p begin="00:06:47.469" end="00:06:48.703">see what you've been up to in the <br/>last few months.</p>
            <p begin="00:06:49.721" end="00:06:52.252">[Graham Larkin] <br/>Welcome! Microphone please</p>
            <p begin="00:06:52.252" end="00:06:54.211">[murmuring]</p>
            <p begin="00:06:54.211" end="00:06:55.223">Let's see if this works</p>
            <p begin="00:07:02.723" end="00:07:04.807">So...</p>
            <p begin="00:07:05.863" end="00:07:06.869">Lovely to be here. Thank you so much....</p>
            <p begin="00:07:08.152" end="00:07:11.713">Deep thanks really need to go out <br/>to Stephen Kovats</p>
            <p begin="00:07:12.224" end="00:07:13.830">You've named all the other names</p>
            <p begin="00:07:14.563" end="00:07:20.504">So, I won't rethank Andrea Boegner <br/>and everyone else who's been so helpful</p>
            <p begin="00:07:20.504" end="00:07:24.595">But, really, hats off to you, Stephen,</p>
            <p begin="00:07:24.737" end="00:07:27.485">for your persistence and your kindness</p>
            <p begin="00:07:27.767" end="00:07:31.276">and just your effectiveness in making all</p>
            <p begin="00:07:31.629" end="00:07:34.374">thirty of these events and not <br/>forgetting me in the next</p>
            <p begin="00:07:35.720" end="00:07:37.586">I'm really grateful for that</p>
            <p begin="00:07:37.810" end="00:07:41.443">it's a herculean amount of effort for you</p>
            <p begin="00:07:43.793" end="00:07:46.527">and it's such a pleasure for me, <br/>so thank you!</p>
            <p begin="00:07:47.334" end="00:07:49.744">So, the McLuhan archive... </p>
            <p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:54.764">You said I was interested in the documents</p>
            <p begin="00:07:55.197" end="00:07:56.601">As opposed to the audiovisual stuff</p>
            <p begin="00:07:56.866" end="00:07:58.476">Well, for me it's sort of all one</p>
            <p begin="00:07:59.085" end="00:08:01.498">And really one of the things, <br/>I'm trying to do</p>
            <p begin="00:08:01.549" end="00:08:05.506">with my limited time and limited <br/>powerpointing abilities</p>
            <p begin="00:08:05.639" end="00:08:10.328">is give you a sense of <br/>the real range of material</p>
            <p begin="00:08:10.583" end="00:08:12.962">much of paper-based</p>
            <p begin="00:08:13.449" end="00:08:17.620">much of it based in this gigantic archive <br/>of Library &amp; Archives Canada</p>
            <p begin="00:08:17.629" end="00:08:21.787">which has an estimated <br/>800,000 sheets of paper</p>
            <p begin="00:08:23.513" end="00:08:25.113">related to McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:08:25.455" end="00:08:27.818">and many of them, photocopies <br/>or articles or whatever</p>
            <p begin="00:08:27.881" end="00:08:30.456">but a lot of original stuff and <br/>manuscripts and typescripts</p>
            <p begin="00:08:30.594" end="00:08:36.649">and I try to give you a flavor <br/>of the variety and depth of that material</p>
            <p begin="00:08:37.891" end="00:08:41.401">But, I think, I'll begin just by saying</p>
            <p begin="00:08:43.329" end="00:08:47.940">why I'm doing what I'm doing <br/>with McLuhan.</p>
            <p begin="00:08:49.369" end="00:08:54.148">It really has largely to do with </p>
            <p begin="00:08:55.845" end="00:08:56.641">my feeling that</p>
            <p begin="00:08:58.086" end="00:08:59.164">we tend to see McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:09:00.378" end="00:09:01.536">above all, I think as...</p>
            <p begin="00:09:02.316" end="00:09:03.852">We tend to put him in certain boxes.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:04.822" end="00:09:06.810">and we see him&#11834;and rightly so.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:10.052">I mean, he really was an kind of <br/>initiator of discourses</p>
            <p begin="00:09:10.436" end="00:09:14.683">to use Foucault's phrase <br/>that he said about Marx and Freud.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:15.464" end="00:09:22.740">But, he really kind of invented, to an <br/>amazing extent, cultural studies</p>
            <p begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:27.076">with The Mechanical Bride, the 1951 book, <br/>along with a few others</p>
            <p begin="00:09:27.473" end="00:09:30.159">But that was really a big deal, <br/>especially in the English speaking world.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:30.201" end="00:09:36.527">And we didn't know in the English <br/>speaking world about Kracauer or Benjamin</p>
            <p begin="00:09:36.884" end="00:09:40.819">or, you know, people who were sort of <br/>doing what could become cultural studies</p>
            <p begin="00:09:40.842" end="00:09:42.649">those translations didn't happen till later</p>
            <p begin="00:09:42.714" end="00:09:44.611">that was only in the English <br/>speaking world</p>
            <p begin="00:09:44.767" end="00:09:47.687">that was really, people here and there</p>
            <p begin="00:09:47.850" end="00:09:50.378">There was Robert Warshaw <br/>or there was Gilbert Seldes, or whatever</p>
            <p begin="00:09:50.828" end="00:09:53.683">But it was really McLuhan who kind of <br/>wrote a book on it and brought it together</p>
            <p begin="00:09:54.017" end="00:09:57.595">with this book published in 1951.</p>
            <p begin="00:09:59.425" end="00:10:03.118">So, as with cultural studies, <br/>he also, of course</p>
            <p begin="00:10:03.605" end="00:10:09.831">is a hugely foundational figure <br/>for communication studies, as well.</p>
            <p begin="00:10:11.341" end="00:10:15.999">And in a way, <br/>probably to the greatest extent,</p>
            <p begin="00:10:16.200" end="00:10:20.809">he has been studied as a theorist</p>
            <p begin="00:10:22.773" end="00:10:27.938">in communication studies and that's <br/>a discipline, I guess it's a discipline</p>
            <p begin="00:10:28.714" end="00:10:30.053">it's alive and well.</p>
            <p begin="00:10:31.923" end="00:10:37.224">An interdisciplinary thing that's <br/>branching off into</p>
            <p begin="00:10:37.569" end="00:10:40.107">media ecology and all kinds of things</p>
            <p begin="00:10:42.295" end="00:10:43.773">And my feeling is that </p>
            <p begin="00:10:44.006" end="00:10:45.473">this McLuhan that I'm saying </p>
            <p begin="00:10:45.678" end="00:10:50.097">has been taken care of and <br/>really attended to by scholars</p>
            <p begin="00:10:51.670" end="00:10:53.954">is the theorist. </p>
            <p begin="00:10:55.943" end="00:11:00.405">And I think that it's ironic</p>
            <p begin="00:11:01.870" end="00:11:06.635">how little has been done on <br/>the material aspects of his practice.</p>
            <p begin="00:11:07.708" end="00:11:13.413">Given the fact that he felt <br/>the medium is the message.</p>
            <p begin="00:11:14.794" end="00:11:18.718">And given the fact, that he said, </p>
            <p begin="00:11:20.441" end="00:11:22.246">"I have percepts about concepts".</p>
            <p begin="00:11:24.077" end="00:11:29.603">and said, that his, correctly in a way, <br/>that his probes and explorations</p>
            <p begin="00:11:30.642" end="00:11:34.941">didn't really add up to anything as <br/>rigorous as a theory.</p>
            <p begin="00:11:37.530" end="00:11:42.253">And so, what I'm trying to do, <br/>is sort of </p>
            <p begin="00:11:43.206" end="00:11:46.039">get with the program a little bit, after <br/>a hundred years</p>
            <p begin="00:11:46.420" end="00:11:49.149">and apply some of his own methods</p>
            <p begin="00:11:50.403" end="00:11:56.472">to his own work, <br/>that is, to look at the media environment</p>
            <p begin="00:11:56.501" end="00:11:57.916">that he was embedded in </p>
            <p begin="00:11:58.406" end="00:12:01.454">and in all of the traces of his own, <br/>what I call his media practice.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:02.360" end="00:12:07.227">And by that, I mean, <br/>not only his productions</p>
            <p begin="00:12:07.389" end="00:12:08.960">but also his receptions</p>
            <p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:11.032">and you'll see what I mean by that.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:11.032" end="00:12:12.265">But basically every... </p>
            <p begin="00:12:13.826" end="00:12:15.382">We're lucky that the archive is so rich</p>
            <p begin="00:12:15.420" end="00:12:17.315">it looks like he just threw nothing away</p>
            <p begin="00:12:17.341" end="00:12:18.947">So, we basically have every piece of paper</p>
            <p begin="00:12:18.956" end="00:12:20.682">that passed through his hands <br/>and then some.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:22.416" end="00:12:26.037">And a lot of traces of his <br/>encounters with other media.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:27.870" end="00:12:33.197">Radio, film, TV and so on.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:34.110" end="00:12:36.584">So, that's really what <br/>I'm going to be unpacking for you.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:36.662" end="00:12:39.541">But as a way in... <br/>what I'm gonna do, is </p>
            <p begin="00:12:40.219" end="00:12:43.141">just start a slideshow here </p>
            <p begin="00:12:43.778" end="00:12:47.989">and maybe try to navigate this space <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:12:48.013" end="00:12:51.840">in a way that allows you to look <br/>at the images and at me</p>
            <p begin="00:12:52.443" end="00:12:56.683">And, give you a little bit of the story <br/>of how I got&#11834;came to McLuhan.</p>
            <p begin="00:12:56.953" end="00:12:59.319">Because in my day job, <br/>up until very recently,</p>
            <p begin="00:12:59.319" end="00:13:01.831">I was curator of painting, sculpture <br/>and decorative arts. So, basically</p>
            <p begin="00:13:01.969" end="00:13:04.150">European &amp; American sculpture with art <br/>at the National Gallery of Canada.</p>
            <p begin="00:13:06.331" end="00:13:08.513">I was trained as an art historian. </p>
            <p begin="00:13:09.613" end="00:13:11.308">and really actually a historian in print</p>
            <p begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:15.466">And I gonna go back now <br/>to a conference</p>
            <p begin="00:13:16.191" end="00:13:21.202">that I co-hosted in 1998 <br/>at Harvard University</p>
            <p begin="00:13:21.432" end="00:13:22.617">when I was a student there.</p>

            <p begin="00:13:30.274" end="00:13:34.694">This was a opportunity to bring together</p>
            <p begin="00:13:36.517" end="00:13:41.102">historians of the printed word, <br/>really literally historians</p>
            <p begin="00:13:41.311" end="00:13:43.115">who were sort of leaning that way </p>
            <p begin="00:13:43.137" end="00:13:45.864">towards the kind of materialistic take <br/>on things</p>
            <p begin="00:13:45.953" end="00:13:48.549">and seeing how meaning is embedded <br/></p>

            <p begin="00:14:07.173" end="00:14:10.405">and I did mention</p>

            <p begin="00:15:19.264" end="00:15:21.229">called "Taking Things Seriously"</p>
            <p begin="00:15:22.117" end="00:15:24.380">which is just a book </p>

            <p begin="00:15:44.458" end="00:15:46.739">Obviously, that's just an example.</p>
            <p begin="00:15:48.375" end="00:15:50.427">And then, after the conference</p>
            <p begin="00:15:50.427" end="00:15:52.987">I ended up writing a doctoral dissertation</p>
            <p begin="00:15:53.248" end="00:16:00.180">on the, in this case, largely based <br/>on these 18th century print albums</p>

            <p begin="00:16:14.634" end="00:16:17.780">I got my hand on all of these photographs</p>
            <p begin="00:16:17.953" end="00:16:21.701">So, I have my hand in 2003 <br/>on the, even then,</p>

            <p begin="00:16:29.513" end="00:16:33.333">and of the function of the thing. </p>
            <p begin="00:16:34.180" end="00:16:38.168">And perhaps, some indication that <br/>I'm not afraid to touch it.</p>
            <p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:45.542">You know, I think that too often <br/>when we look at media,</p>
            <p begin="00:16:45.542" end="00:16:47.334">as such as a printed book <br/>or a printed image</p>
            <p begin="00:16:47.334" end="00:16:49.238">things kind of get posterized. </p>
            <p begin="00:16:49.238" end="00:16:52.014">And you lose a sense of the, <br/>sort of, a texture</p>
            <p begin="00:16:53.254" end="00:16:55.245">and, you know, the full tactility. </p>
            <p begin="00:16:57.507" end="00:17:02.187">And so intersensory fulness of <br/>these objects.</p>

            <p begin="00:17:42.982" end="00:17:45.505">as he is as well, he uses a lot of those</p>
            <p begin="00:17:45.944" end="00:17:48.106">And I am not afraid to </p>
            <p begin="00:17:54.278" end="00:17:54.785">to use collage of text, as well as images</p>
            <p begin="00:17:56.243" end="00:18:00.097">So, as I say, I was living in Ottawa</p>
            <p begin="00:18:02.555" end="00:18:05.471">Pretty much, down the street <br/>from where I worked at National Gallery</p>
            <p begin="00:18:06.029" end="00:18:08.057">was the Library and Archives of Canada.</p>
            <p begin="00:18:10.223" end="00:18:14.234">I was very excited about the possibility </p>
            <p begin="00:18:14.344" end="00:18:16.536">of doing something for the centennial <br/>of McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:18:17.014" end="00:18:19.107">But what I really wanted to do </p>
            <p begin="00:18:19.107" end="00:18:21.047">was to have an exhibition somewhere</p>
            <p begin="00:18:21.172" end="00:18:23.971">ideally at LAC, <br/>Library Archives Canada</p>
            <p begin="00:18:24.287" end="00:18:26.578">That would bring together </p>
            <p begin="00:18:27.277" end="00:18:28.841">Well, I had this idea, <br/>that I'd bring together</p>
            <p begin="00:18:28.861" end="00:18:31.480">a hundred objects and call it <br/>'McLuhan Century'</p>
            <p begin="00:18:32.438" end="00:18:35.047">There would be, a kind of a, very </p>
            <p begin="00:18:36.146" end="00:18:38.770">thick description, <br/>a reading of each of these objects</p>
            <p begin="00:18:39.330" end="00:18:42.687">that shows how it exemplifies his <br/>engagements</p>
            <p begin="00:18:43.028" end="00:18:44.856">with various kinds of media.</p>
            <p begin="00:18:46.861" end="00:18:50.719">And here, we have the detail of <br/>the webpage</p>
            <p begin="00:18:51.177" end="00:18:52.555">you can go onto the LAC webpage</p>
            <p begin="00:18:52.570" end="00:18:55.388">you can get a many hundreds of pages of </p>
            <p begin="00:18:55.388" end="00:18:57.043">a finding aid of the collection</p>
            <p begin="00:18:57.800" end="00:18:58.995">You can see here summarized</p>
            <p begin="00:18:59.639" end="00:19:02.630">just what's in 43.6 meters of <br/>textual records.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:02.951" end="00:19:04.274">That's 800,000 papers</p>
            <p begin="00:19:05.195" end="00:19:06.523">That's shelf meters</p>
            <p begin="00:19:08.310" end="00:19:10.058">And various other stuff. </p>
            <p begin="00:19:10.058" end="00:19:12.910">Including audio cassettes and <br/>audio discs and reels and films</p>
            <p begin="00:19:12.910" end="00:19:15.042">And some of these things are just stuff, <br/>it's just stuff he had</p>
            <p begin="00:19:15.679" end="00:19:19.541">so it might not be directly of him, <br/>its not necessarily of him</p>
            <p begin="00:19:20.173" end="00:19:24.202">Just as all the papers are not <br/>necessarily things written by him.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:24.456" end="00:19:27.543">But, it's all stuff <br/>that was from him</p>
            <p begin="00:19:27.543" end="00:19:30.703">and acquired and catalogued <br/>in the mid 80s.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:31.416" end="00:19:33.765">Once it was acquired.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:34.182" end="00:19:36.486">There really wasn't a lot of interest <br/>from Library &amp; Archives Canada</p>
            <p begin="00:19:36.486" end="00:19:39.600">There really wasn't <br/>a lot of interest from them.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:41.593">So, I kept coming back to them</p>
            <p begin="00:19:41.593" end="00:19:46.809">and I came with my buddy Dominique <br/>Scheffel-Dunand who is in Toronto.</p>
            <p begin="00:19:46.916" end="00:19:52.306">and who did a wonderful McLuhan festival <br/>along with Berlin, just the biggest</p>
            <p begin="00:19:52.452" end="00:19:54.700">McLuhan celebration this year, <br/>this centenary</p>
            <p begin="00:19:55.955" end="00:20:00.423">We tried to get something going with <br/>them, the Science &amp; Tech Museum.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:00.835" end="00:20:02.589">And again, about McLuhan's...</p>
            <p begin="00:20:02.589" end="00:20:06.371">There would be an exhibition of <br/>McLuhan's engagement with media.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:06.740" end="00:20:11.613">I popped into Robert Bean <br/>a photographer</p>
            <p begin="00:20:11.677" end="00:20:13.357">told him about the archive </p>
            <p begin="00:20:13.373" end="00:20:15.927">and he really ran with it and <br/>has done a number of exhibitions</p>
            <p begin="00:20:16.068" end="00:20:19.084">Now, we're actually looking, <br/>we're getting into the library now.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:19.300" end="00:20:21.111">For the moment, the photographs </p>
            <p begin="00:20:21.206" end="00:20:25.584">taken by Robert Bean, <br/>when he went there with me</p>
            <p begin="00:20:25.831" end="00:20:26.827">over a year ago.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:27.103" end="00:20:31.181">I think it was in around May of 2010 <br/>to get in there.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:31.181" end="00:20:33.835">Now we're in the reserve room.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:34.784" end="00:20:37.998">So, we're getting closer to the material</p>
            <p begin="00:20:38.432" end="00:20:39.663">And there we are, or I am</p>
            <p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:45.326">And there: <br/>boxes of&#11834;from McLuhan Archive</p>
            <p begin="00:20:45.326" end="00:20:46.732">some of you may&#11834;</p>
            <p begin="00:20:46.732" end="00:20:49.991">Can we have a show hands, has someone <br/>actually been in the McLuhan Archive?</p>
            <p begin="00:20:50.655" end="00:20:51.846">Yeah, that's what I figured. </p>
            <p begin="00:20:51.873" end="00:20:54.061">I mean, in Canada, it's a rarity</p>
            <p begin="00:20:55.361" end="00:20:58.107">There's many McLuhan scholars <br/>who haven't been in there.</p>
            <p begin="00:20:58.151" end="00:21:00.899">So, that's good, this will <br/>be fresh for you.</p>
            <p begin="00:21:02.651" end="00:21:06.596">Here you can see, <br/>I'm looking at a scrapbook</p>
            <p begin="00:21:06.871" end="00:21:08.440">That was assembled in the 60s</p>
            <p begin="00:21:08.449" end="00:21:10.951">by McLuhan and I suspect </p>
            <p begin="00:21:11.071" end="00:21:15.302">Corinne, his wife, <br/>who did a lot of typing for him.</p>
            <p begin="00:21:20.790" end="00:21:22.536">I'm not afraid to touch these things.</p>
            <p begin="00:21:23.765" end="00:21:26.544">Now, this exhibition hall, <br/>I went to LAC</p>
            <p begin="00:21:26.544" end="00:21:28.726">if you go pass Glenn Gould's piano <br/>which is a bit sad</p>
            <p begin="00:21:28.726" end="00:21:31.648">because its unused and under this funny <br/>quilted thing.</p>
            <p begin="00:21:31.648" end="00:21:33.091">And you get to this area here </p>
            <p begin="00:21:33.095" end="00:21:35.137">which is this exhibition room </p>
            <p begin="00:21:35.162" end="00:21:37.593">There is an exhibition on there</p>
            <p begin="00:21:37.593" end="00:21:39.346">when I went with Dominique</p>
            <p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:41.975">on Gabriel Roi, this Canadian author</p>
            <p begin="00:21:42.663" end="00:21:45.166">and we said, well, can we have it?</p>
            <p begin="00:21:45.446" end="00:21:48.700">for 2011 and do a McLuhan thing?</p>
            <p begin="00:21:49.263" end="00:21:51.107">They said, "No, no, no, we're done." </p>
            <p begin="00:21:51.107" end="00:21:53.181">We're not having any <br/>McLuhan exhibitions.</p>
            <p begin="00:21:53.181" end="00:21:54.976">We're going digital now.</p>
            <p begin="00:21:58.551" end="00:22:00.042">That's what it looks like now.</p>
            <p begin="00:22:00.231" end="00:22:02.592">There's nothing going on, anymore. </p>
            <p begin="00:22:06.203" end="00:22:07.176">They actually had to cut 40 positions </p>
            <p begin="00:22:07.577" end="00:22:10.054">in the last three years </p>
            <p begin="00:22:10.327" end="00:22:12.330">Just to have a National Gallery, <br/>including my own.</p>
            <p begin="00:22:14.420" end="00:22:17.792">It's a pretty rough time <br/>and it's a major library</p>
            <p begin="00:22:18.153" end="00:22:19.871">Most of the list <br/>I can find on the web</p>
            <p begin="00:22:19.976" end="00:22:21.812">the 4th biggest of the world</p>
            <p begin="00:22:23.303" end="00:22:26.223">That's the library not this list</p>
            <p begin="00:22:26.280" end="00:22:28.069">But I'm sure as archive as well</p>
            <p begin="00:22:28.241" end="00:22:29.566">It's substantial and yet</p>
            <p begin="00:22:29.713" end="00:22:31.618">It's a bit sepulchral in there these days</p>
            <p begin="00:22:31.823" end="00:22:35.842">It's a bit of a tomb</p>
            <p begin="00:22:37.818" end="00:22:39.763">So, that's the background</p>
            <p begin="00:22:40.675" end="00:22:42.462">And, what I was able to do, </p>
            <p begin="00:22:43.362" end="00:22:45.096">in lieu of an exhibition is</p>
            <p begin="00:22:46.505" end="00:22:47.744">the talk you're about to see,</p>
            <p begin="00:22:47.842" end="00:22:48.831"> the study you're about to see</p>
            <p begin="00:22:49.252" end="00:22:54.089">which is really the first time <br/>I'm coming out in public </p>
            <p begin="00:22:54.801" end="00:23:00.748">with my exposition on McLuhan's <br/>engagements with media</p>
            <p begin="00:23:00.922" end="00:23:02.066">The way I have set it up</p>
            <p begin="00:23:02.561" end="00:23:03.592">is thematically</p>
            <p begin="00:23:04.656" end="00:23:07.168">these themes are also <br/>pretty much chronological</p>
            <p begin="00:23:08.169" end="00:23:14.360">That is, they reflect whatever stage of <br/>McLuhan's practice that he's at.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:14.937" end="00:23:16.107">And like all of us,</p>
            <p begin="00:23:17.930" end="00:23:20.741">maybe we, we're talking before we watch TV</p>
            <p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:22.297">So, we start with orality.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:25.669" end="00:23:27.722">Now, orality is, you know,</p>
            <p begin="00:23:28.542" end="00:23:32.964">is something that was <br/>of great interest to McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:23:34.752" end="00:23:38.502">He really, you know, he looked at <br/>speech as technology</p>
            <p begin="00:23:38.555" end="00:23:40.440">He looked at writing <br/>as a technology.</p>
            <p begin="00:23:40.440" end="00:23:42.980">He always had this big picture. </p>
            <p begin="00:23:44.471" end="00:23:49.952">In the studies in orality, of which there <br/>were many amazing ones in the 20th century</p>
            <p begin="00:23:50.621" end="00:23:54.228">His favourite and still my favourite, <br/>I think</p>
            <p begin="00:23:54.780" end="00:23:57.736">is Eric Havelock's 1963 <br/>'Preface to Plato'</p>
            <p begin="00:23:57.925" end="00:24:00.303">which is an incredible book <br/>that talks about</p>
            <p begin="00:24:01.008" end="00:24:03.392">the rise of literacy </p>
            <p begin="00:24:05.505" end="00:24:07.353">and what it meant for greek culture</p>
            <p begin="00:24:08.529" end="00:24:11.036">and what it meant for the oral culture</p>
            <p begin="00:24:11.733" end="00:24:13.397">and how it was a real game changer</p>
            <p begin="00:24:14.732" end="00:24:16.136">I'm also showing you a book </p>
            <p begin="00:24:16.136" end="00:24:20.364">by McLuhan's disciple/pupil</p>
            <p begin="00:24:21.033" end="00:24:22.921">He turns 100 next year <br/>by the way</p>
            <p begin="00:24:23.042" end="00:24:25.734">There's gonna be some <br/>celebration in St. Lewis in Walter Ong</p>
            <p begin="00:24:27.303" end="00:24:28.876">He wrote a book, </p>
            <p begin="00:24:28.876" end="00:24:30.909">sadly published 2 years after <br/>McLuhan's death.</p>
            <p begin="00:24:30.909" end="00:24:32.712">So this is published in 1982</p>
            <p begin="00:24:33.317" end="00:24:35.066">called "Orality and Literacy"</p>
            <p begin="00:24:35.324" end="00:24:36.927">which is really the best introduction <br/>to that subject</p>
            <p begin="00:24:37.234" end="00:24:39.376">It's a beautiful synopsis that </p>
            <p begin="00:24:40.088" end="00:24:43.512">coins the term secondary orality</p>
            <p begin="00:24:43.642" end="00:24:47.788">to talk about what happens <br/>when we're literate</p>
            <p begin="00:24:48.385" end="00:24:56.293">but we're still experiencing <br/>various oral situations. </p>
            <p begin="00:24:56.993" end="00:24:59.322">It's a kind of overlay </p>
            <p begin="00:24:59.739" end="00:25:00.648">and it's very good </p>
            <p begin="00:25:00.762" end="00:25:03.993">it's a reminder that it's not one thing <br/>just transplants another</p>

            <p begin="00:25:06.504" end="00:25:09.331">Things get hybrid, <br/>as McLuhan would say.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:10.592" end="00:25:13.074">And now, we gonna go back <br/>to the first object</p>
            <p begin="00:25:13.715" end="00:25:15.501">I'm going to show you from the archive</p>
            <p begin="00:25:16.506" end="00:25:22.353">What it is, is evidence of McLuhan's <br/>pre-literate phase</p>
            <p begin="00:25:23.323" end="00:25:24.668">It's a letter from his grandma</p>
            <p begin="00:25:26.512" end="00:25:28.122">That it's just on a scrap of paper <br/>there is one side</p>
            <p begin="00:25:28.138" end="00:25:29.546">and there is the other side.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:30.036" end="00:25:31.248">And it says: "Dear Marshall,..." </p>
            <p begin="00:25:31.248" end="00:25:32.705">So, we're now.. </p>
            <p begin="00:25:33.205" end="00:25:34.933">he was born in 1911. </p>
            <p begin="00:25:35.203" end="00:25:38.443">So, we're maybe 1916 something like that.</p>
            <p begin="00:25:39.227" end="00:25:41.922">and we can pin-point it a little bit</p>
            <p begin="00:25:42.283" end="00:25:43.668">As you will see...</p>
            <p begin="00:25:43.702" end="00:25:45.511">"Dear Marshall, so far away..."</p>
            <p begin="00:25:50.609" end="00:25:52.220">"I would like..."</p>
            <p begin="00:25:53.831" end="00:25:55.442">-- Sorry, it's harder to read off here -- <br/>"I would like to see you so much</p>
            <p begin="00:25:55.442" end="00:25:57.070">but you are so far away. </p>
            <p begin="00:25:58.225" end="00:26:00.953">I hope to see you all some time<br/>in warm weather.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:01.937" end="00:26:05.534">We're having great cold, much colder <br/>weather here than last winter.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:06.751" end="00:26:09.391">And I'm glad, you're trying to study! <br/>Keep at it!</p>
            <p begin="00:26:11.238" end="00:26:13.918">And you can soon learn to read and write.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:15.876" end="00:26:19.559">Then I know, you will write me a letter <br/>with your own dear hand."</p>
            <p begin="00:26:20.644" end="00:26:22.016">So, Marshall doesn't know how to write <br/>yet, read or write yet</p>
            <p begin="00:26:25.712" end="00:26:30.037">This is a scribbling -- <br/>almost certainly by the young Marshall</p>
            <p begin="00:26:31.569" end="00:26:34.773">on the back of mimiograph </p>
            <p begin="00:26:35.495" end="00:26:36.882">that is dated from 1915.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:39.673" end="00:26:41.631">Which is a great special interest of me</p>
            <p begin="00:26:41.631" end="00:26:46.088">because McLuhan he became a real <br/>power-user of mimiographs.</p>
            <p begin="00:26:46.403" end="00:26:49.113">By ca. 1950 / 51. </p>
            <p begin="00:26:49.926" end="00:26:54.001">He was really into self-publishing</p>
            <p begin="00:26:55.593" end="00:26:59.513">Things were kind of proto-blogs in 1951 </p>
            <p begin="00:26:59.513" end="00:27:01.932">The mimiograph was the way to do that.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:06.082" end="00:27:06.974">So now, we get to his literacy.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:08.734" end="00:27:09.950">And I want to emphasize </p>
            <p begin="00:27:10.750" end="00:27:13.514">the reception as much as the production</p>
            <p begin="00:27:14.338" end="00:27:15.716">of this media environment. </p>
            <p begin="00:27:18.922" end="00:27:23.079">So, here's a valentine to Marshall <br/>from a secret admirer.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:24.941" end="00:27:27.553">That he doubtless received at a <br/>very young age.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:29.636" end="00:27:32.297">Here, is Marshall practicing his cursives</p>
            <p begin="00:27:32.736" end="00:27:34.683">So, you can see Marshall at the top </p>
            <p begin="00:27:35.265" end="00:27:37.078">and then various writing exercises,</p>
            <p begin="00:27:37.078" end="00:27:38.421">This is the sort of check bar, </p>
            <p begin="00:27:38.421" end="00:27:39.467">for the teacher to show</p>
            <p begin="00:27:39.467" end="00:27:45.500">that it's been properly surveilled <br/>by the teacher.</p>
            <p begin="00:27:46.494" end="00:27:48.303">This is a kind of examples </p>
            <p begin="00:27:48.455" end="00:27:52.025">I don't need to convince you <br/>that he knew how to read and write. </p>
            <p begin="00:27:52.762" end="00:27:54.336">But I just want to <br/>give you a taste</p>
            <p begin="00:27:54.713" end="00:27:58.374">of the archive, by showing you <br/>this collection of cigar bands</p>
            <p begin="00:27:58.487" end="00:28:01.812">that were in a book that Marshall owned.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:02.597" end="00:28:04.469">And I like it on many levels. </p>
            <p begin="00:28:04.479" end="00:28:06.009">But not least because</p>
            <p begin="00:28:06.668" end="00:28:09.082">it really shows <br/>text and image together.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:10.864" end="00:28:13.704">I think in some way it kind of shows</p>
            <p begin="00:28:13.730" end="00:28:15.354">the inseparability of these things.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:16.050" end="00:28:19.794">It shows that print is often --</p>
            <p begin="00:28:20.195" end="00:28:23.449">-- image, as well, as text, or image <br/>mixed in with text it's complicated.</p>
            <p begin="00:28:27.201" end="00:28:28.986">-- Something went wrong with this slide --</p>
            <p begin="00:28:29.073" end="00:28:31.781">It's supposed to say <br/>'Listening and Watching'</p>
            <p begin="00:28:35.343" end="00:28:37.878">So here we get to radio</p>
            <p begin="00:28:39.849" end="00:28:41.879">And if I go up here</p>
            <p begin="00:28:41.972" end="00:28:44.153">What I'm gonna do, is play you an <br/>audio clip</p>

            <p begin="00:29:14.468" end="00:29:16.576">was that, Marshall had a keen interest in </p>
            <p begin="00:29:17.324" end="00:29:18.495">everything that's going on </p>
            <p begin="00:29:19.169" end="00:29:21.683">It was radio, that was breaking at <br/>that time</p>
            <p begin="00:29:22.423" end="00:29:24.193">He was the one who build </p>

            <p begin="00:29:26.904" end="00:29:30.467">And we would go to sleep as kids <br/>in the same bed</p>
            <p begin="00:29:31.584" end="00:29:33.045">We didn't have separate <br/>rooms at that time</p>
            <p begin="00:29:33.670" end="00:29:35.269"> And we divided the receivers</p>
            <p begin="00:29:37.987" end="00:29:40.969">And we'd find a very good point in the <br/>crystal for a program. And we would</p>
            <p begin="00:29:40.969" end="00:29:46.254">fall asleep [chuckles] with the receiver <br/>on the pillow and our ear against it."</p>

            <p begin="00:32:37.536" end="00:32:39.282">and reconstruct with great exactitude</p>
            <p begin="00:32:41.008" end="00:32:44.605">exactly which movies <br/>Marshall was looking at</p>
            <p begin="00:32:44.768" end="00:32:47.328">and which radio he was listening to <br/>and so on... at a given time</p>
            <p begin="00:32:47.328" end="00:32:49.844">I think, it's terribly important </p>
            <p begin="00:32:51.748" end="00:32:53.822">for the following reason:</p>
            <p begin="00:32:56.694" end="00:32:59.247">I'm kind of a McLuhan sceptic in many ways</p>
            <p begin="00:32:59.247" end="00:33:01.860">and one of the things, <br/>I felt about his theories</p>
            <p begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:06.660">was that there weren't necessarily <br/>as well researched as they should be </p>
            <p begin="00:33:07.400" end="00:33:08.834">You know and there are a little bit...</p>
            <p begin="00:33:09.378" end="00:33:10.799">you know, <br/>a book like 'Understanding Media'</p>
            <p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:13.226">is almost biting up more than you can chew</p>
            <p begin="00:33:13.226" end="00:33:15.696">I mean, how can you possibly know really</p>
            <p begin="00:33:15.696" end="00:33:16.958">about all this media, come on!</p>
            <p begin="00:33:17.278" end="00:33:19.297">It was a really important synthesis</p>
            <p begin="00:33:19.728" end="00:33:21.484">and it's really a useful book</p>
            <p begin="00:33:21.605" end="00:33:24.500">But also though well <br/>how well researched can this be?</p>
            <p begin="00:33:25.454" end="00:33:26.833">But when you think about it,</p>
            <p begin="00:33:29.301" end="00:33:32.106">we all have deep experience <br/>with all kinds of media </p>
            <p begin="00:33:32.692" end="00:33:33.755">throughout our lives.</p>
            <p begin="00:33:33.755" end="00:33:35.141">I think, <br/>it was his life experience</p>
            <p begin="00:33:35.141" end="00:33:37.485">that really gave McLuhan <br/>that kind of expertise</p>
            <p begin="00:33:37.855" end="00:33:38.951">in combination with the fact</p>
            <p begin="00:33:38.951" end="00:33:39.911">that he was paying attention</p>
            <p begin="00:33:39.911" end="00:33:41.924">he was, as he used to say,</p>
            <p begin="00:33:41.924" end="00:33:45.206">"The fish that was paying attention <br/>to the water"</p>
            <p begin="00:33:46.874" end="00:33:49.012">So, in looking at these details, <br/>I come to think</p>
            <p begin="00:33:51.150" end="00:33:53.290">Well, sure, of course he <br/>knew what a movie was</p>
            <p begin="00:33:56.376" end="00:33:59.372">Another example...</p>
            <p begin="00:33:59.372" end="00:34:02.368">Viva Villa this movie about the <br/>Mexican revolution.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:02.368" end="00:34:05.366">it was a stirring picture excellently <br/>produced and so on.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:05.461" end="00:34:07.856">I mean, there is tons of this evidence</p>
            <p begin="00:34:08.718" end="00:34:11.107">And then, of course, <br/>I show his view of his office</p>
            <p begin="00:34:11.107" end="00:34:11.897">Just because it has a TV</p>
            <p begin="00:34:11.897" end="00:34:13.660">and I don't need to remind you <br/>of the fact</p>
            <p begin="00:34:13.660" end="00:34:19.870">that he commented a lot on TV <br/>and how supplanted print</p>
            <p begin="00:34:20.914" end="00:34:22.480">There's something funny about <br/>these headers</p>
            <p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:24.312">I think, we just see very partial views </p>
            <p begin="00:34:25.690" end="00:34:27.449">Maybe it's just a thought font <br/>that's going funny</p>
            <p begin="00:34:28.944" end="00:34:30.419">This section is called </p>
            <p begin="00:34:30.419" end="00:34:31.563">"Being a Character"</p>
            <p begin="00:34:31.862" end="00:34:34.441">As I said, he's a kind of thematic <br/>and kind of chronological</p>
            <p begin="00:34:34.764" end="00:34:37.198">and why I am interested in this <br/>little section</p>
            <p begin="00:34:38.018" end="00:34:39.259">is really talking about </p>
            <p begin="00:34:39.989" end="00:34:42.398">McLuhan's interest in rethoric</p>
            <p begin="00:34:43.453" end="00:34:46.566">And not the least in the performative <br/>aspects of the rhetor</p>
            <p begin="00:34:50.514" end="00:34:52.075">Of which his mother was one.</p>
            <p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:55.049">As you may know</p>
            <p begin="00:34:55.049" end="00:34:59.502">Elsie McLuhan was a, what was called, <br/>an elocutionist</p>
            <p begin="00:35:00.121" end="00:35:03.130">Or as we see here a reader <br/>and impersonator</p>
            <p begin="00:35:03.759" end="00:35:09.595">which in the pre-cinema age was a way <br/>you got your kicks, was going out</p>
            <p begin="00:35:09.677" end="00:35:12.288">and seeing these kind of <br/>vaudeville-type shows.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:12.486" end="00:35:15.164">of various types.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:16.187" end="00:35:18.476">That would sometimes consist of people <br/>getting up on a stage and </p>
            <p begin="00:35:18.476" end="00:35:19.750">giving recitations.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:20.770" end="00:35:26.638">Original or else straight up <br/>annotations or</p>
            <p begin="00:35:26.638" end="00:35:28.843">Recitations of anything, really.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:29.545" end="00:35:30.740">High and low</p>
            <p begin="00:35:30.740" end="00:35:32.506">And that's what she, his mother, </p>
            <p begin="00:35:32.506" end="00:35:34.303">- the very mother <br/>to whom he was writing -</p>
            <p begin="00:35:34.385" end="00:35:38.076">with such alacrity about <br/>about whatever latest movie he'd seen</p>
            <p begin="00:35:38.271" end="00:35:40.754">That's what she did for a living <br/>back in Canada.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:41.761" end="00:35:44.082">And there's a picture, and a detail -<br/></p>
            <p begin="00:35:44.225" end="00:35:45.773">of that same photo that has a TV in it.</p>
            <p begin="00:35:47.494" end="00:35:51.246">And she's very, very important to Marshall</p>
            <p begin="00:35:51.433" end="00:35:53.338">much more so than his father</p>
            <p begin="00:35:55.083" end="00:35:56.512">And now I'm gonna show you </p>
            <p begin="00:35:56.809" end="00:36:00.107">a document from 1933</p>
            <p begin="00:36:01.048" end="00:36:08.875">which is the brochure that is the <br/>commemoration of the graduation,</p>
            <p begin="00:36:08.888" end="00:36:17.679">Marshall's graduation in 1933 <br/>from his M.A. at University of Manitoba</p>
            <p begin="00:36:18.095" end="00:36:21.105">And, what's interesting, is that, <br/>of course</p>
            <p begin="00:36:21.105" end="00:36:22.920">they've got valedictory addresses, <br/>and so on</p>
            <p begin="00:36:22.920" end="00:36:24.599">But what's interesting is how McLuhan </p>
            <p begin="00:36:25.162" end="00:36:26.303">makes these notes. </p>
            <p begin="00:36:26.821" end="00:36:30.573">So, I guess, this is prof. H.N.Fieldhouse <br/>"who talked about cheese"</p>
            <p begin="00:36:31.350" end="00:36:33.862">And this other, <br/>I am not sure which one of these</p>
            <p begin="00:36:33.862" end="00:36:35.930">was John Thomson or Thelma Wright</p>
            <p begin="00:36:36.876" end="00:36:39.986">"Who showed the advantages of <br/>Miss Mitchell's training"</p>
            <p begin="00:36:40.361" end="00:36:44.142">Maybe this is someone, <br/>who was training kids in rethoric</p>
            <p begin="00:36:44.469" end="00:36:46.621">And then on the back -- he doesn't stop</p>
            <p begin="00:36:46.638" end="00:36:49.142">he then goes in the back, <br/>the whole thing is covered </p>
            <p begin="00:36:49.436" end="00:36:52.219">and he just goes on and on in great detail</p>
            <p begin="00:36:52.247" end="00:36:56.728">in this sort of assessment <br/>of his performances of the academy</p>
            <p begin="00:36:58.108" end="00:37:00.307">Black spoke in puerile poly syllables</p>
            <p begin="00:37:02.057" end="00:37:10.344">of the osbornian variety sons of the <br/>Osbornian curiosity or something?</p>
            <p begin="00:37:10.770" end="00:37:15.626">He really goes in great detail in these <br/>analyses of people's rhetorical skills.</p>
            <p begin="00:37:18.201" end="00:37:19.712">And here he is again, next year</p>
            <p begin="00:37:19.769" end="00:37:26.337">Now, we're in Cambridge this is <br/>the fall term of 1934</p>
            <p begin="00:37:26.337" end="00:37:28.634">when he started at the <br/>University of Cambridge in England</p>
            <p begin="00:37:29.305" end="00:37:32.886">And sure enough he's going to debates <br/>and annoting heavily</p>
            <p begin="00:37:34.031" end="00:37:41.625">So, Mr. Alport was "business-like, <br/>monotone, patting Britain on the back"</p>
            <p begin="00:37:43.330" end="00:37:47.416">Mr. I.M.C. Braby <br/>was "frightfully confident"</p>

            <p begin="00:37:51.085" end="00:37:53.501">Mr. A. Duff Cooper was "fiery" - <br/>and you know, etc.</p>
            <p begin="00:37:55.398" end="00:38:03.054">So, he was very quite deep into <br/>this aspect of orality.</p>
            <p begin="00:38:04.565" end="00:38:07.810">About the performative aspect of speaking</p>
            <p begin="00:38:08.876" end="00:38:09.805">and now, I'm showing you, </p>
            <p begin="00:38:10.451" end="00:38:12.887">is a book called "A Character Anthology"</p>
            <p begin="00:38:13.229" end="00:38:14.583">One of the unpublished books, </p>
            <p begin="00:38:14.589" end="00:38:18.932">one of the, quite a few, <br/>unpublished big studies that he</p>
            <p begin="00:38:19.853" end="00:38:21.927">assembled in the 1940's</p>
            <p begin="00:38:21.934" end="00:38:24.543">So this is before he has eventually <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:38:24.543" end="00:38:26.489">started work on the Mechanical Bride <br/>in the late '40s</p>
            <p begin="00:38:26.833" end="00:38:28.359">But there's all these books <br/>that are unpublished</p>

            <p begin="00:38:46.489" end="00:38:47.221">Well it's complicated.</p>
            <p begin="00:38:47.468" end="00:38:49.140">There was the 17th century</p>
            <p begin="00:38:49.683" end="00:38:52.294">In the early 17th century <br/>throughout much of Europe</p>
            <p begin="00:38:52.513" end="00:38:54.727">it was common to have these <br/>books of characters</p>
            <p begin="00:38:54.727" end="00:38:56.458">that were based on this ancient writer</p>
            <p begin="00:38:56.908" end="00:39:00.075">in the tradition of this ancient writer <br/>named Theophrastus - anyway</p>
            <p begin="00:39:00.077" end="00:39:02.280">So, here it is. He's doing <br/>kind of a retro thing.</p>

            <p begin="00:39:51.254" end="00:39:52.423">"The Mechanical Bride."</p>
            <p begin="00:39:52.423" end="00:39:55.379">But first, there's this thing called, <br/>"The New American Vortex"</p>
            <p begin="00:39:55.913" end="00:39:59.346">which was really on contemporary <br/>modernist</p>
            <p begin="00:39:59.408" end="00:40:00.798">American writers </p>
            <p begin="00:40:01.625" end="00:40:02.623">And then this thing --</p>
            <p begin="00:40:02.686" end="00:40:06.883">these are little note cards <br/>for a book called</p>
            <p begin="00:40:06.883" end="00:40:08.422">"The Guide to Chaos"</p>
            <p begin="00:40:08.538" end="00:40:11.607">a preparation for a book that he called</p>
            <p begin="00:40:11.607" end="00:40:12.983">"The Guide to Chaos"</p>
            <p begin="00:40:13.460" end="00:40:14.748">I tell you what that is in a second</p>
            <p begin="00:40:14.908" end="00:40:16.315">But I want to show you </p>
            <p begin="00:40:16.461" end="00:40:18.171">there are also these scrapbook pages</p>
            <p begin="00:40:18.479" end="00:40:20.245">also portions of scrapbook pages</p>
            <p begin="00:40:20.428" end="00:40:23.915">that are really the raw materials <br/>for this guide</p>
            <p begin="00:40:24.875" end="00:40:26.812">And, what it is... </p>
            <p begin="00:40:27.460" end="00:40:28.766">is the book that,</p>
            <p begin="00:40:28.766" end="00:40:30.897">after one other name change, became</p>
            <p begin="00:40:30.916" end="00:40:33.411">"The Mechanical Bride"</p>
            <p begin="00:40:35.701" end="00:40:37.955">And so, as we get into <br/>the later notes</p>
            <p begin="00:40:37.955" end="00:40:39.988">It's MB or McBride. So theres reams <br/>of them</p>
            <p begin="00:40:44.140" end="00:40:47.516">l mean just -- <br/>it goes on and on.</p>
            <p begin="00:40:48.223" end="00:40:49.822">Then we have manuscripts </p>
            <p begin="00:40:50.068" end="00:40:53.165">in this case for the introduction <br/>to the "Mechanical Bride"</p>
            <p begin="00:40:53.631" end="00:40:55.016">we have typescripts </p>
            <p begin="00:40:57.157" end="00:40:59.121">and then, among all these files </p>
            <p begin="00:40:59.121" end="00:41:00.768">we sometimes have even the original files <br/>that he had </p>
            <p begin="00:41:00.768" end="00:41:02.415">If there is something</p>
            <p begin="00:41:02.415" end="00:41:04.063">with some writing on it</p>
            <p begin="00:41:04.063" end="00:41:06.268">like this one called "Beautiful Bodies" <br/>which was one of his</p>
            <p begin="00:41:06.268" end="00:41:08.209">exhibits, he called, </p>
            <p begin="00:41:08.209" end="00:41:09.295">One of his </p>
            <p begin="00:41:12.182" end="00:41:13.888">specimens for analysis.</p>
            <p begin="00:41:14.037" end="00:41:15.406">Basically if...</p>
            <p begin="00:41:16.063" end="00:41:18.537">Usually it's just a single advertisement <br/>-- there is one the book became in the end</p>
            <p begin="00:41:18.593" end="00:41:21.823">This one is called 'Beautiful Bodies'</p>
            <p begin="00:41:21.903" end="00:41:22.885">I think it came in the same one</p>
            <p begin="00:41:23.360" end="00:41:25.449">It's hard to keep track <br/>after seeing all these</p>
            <p begin="00:41:25.450" end="00:41:27.609">Because there's hundreds, I think, </p>
            <p begin="00:41:27.609" end="00:41:29.334">and many didn't even make it into</p>
            <p begin="00:41:29.334" end="00:41:32.091">the 50 that actually became <br/>the Mechanical Bride</p>
            <p begin="00:41:32.091" end="00:41:35.713">This "Beautiful Bodies" was about a</p>
            <p begin="00:41:36.338" end="00:41:39.946">kind of pin-up advertisement <br/>for a funeral home</p>
            <p begin="00:41:40.513" end="00:41:42.186">which greatly amused him.</p>
            <p begin="00:41:42.343" end="00:41:44.182">And so he thought: <br/>I gotta write about this.</p>
            <p begin="00:41:47.960" end="00:41:50.792">-- why is that not going forward --</p>
            <p begin="00:41:50.946" end="00:41:52.157">Here's another one</p>
            <p begin="00:41:52.157" end="00:41:52.961">This one is originally called </p>
            <p begin="00:41:52.961" end="00:41:53.765">"Hygiene" and then he had a snappier title</p>
            <p begin="00:41:53.765" end="00:41:54.570">"How Not to Offend"</p>
            <p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:41:59.949">and that's all about <br/>various hygiene products</p>
            <p begin="00:41:59.949" end="00:42:03.845">like deodorants .. or</p>
            <p begin="00:42:04.774" end="00:42:06.082">tooth paste or mouth wash</p>
            <p begin="00:42:07.370" end="00:42:09.807">and here to what we have, <br/>is all of the clippings</p>
            <p begin="00:42:10.115" end="00:42:13.606">in the eventual book that is <br/>the "Mechanical Bride" </p>
            <p begin="00:42:13.833" end="00:42:15.299">all we have is one image.</p>
            <p begin="00:42:15.901" end="00:42:18.708">And his son Eric tells me, that <br/>the images in that book</p>
            <p begin="00:42:19.197" end="00:42:22.405">were actually made from slides </p>
            <p begin="00:42:22.562" end="00:42:24.906">and that Mechanical Bride in the 1940s </p>
            <p begin="00:42:24.906" end="00:42:27.550">started out as a kind of <br/>travelling slide lecture</p>
            <p begin="00:42:27.752" end="00:42:28.907">which is very interesting</p>
            <p begin="00:42:30.658" end="00:42:32.914">so they are actually quite fading <br/>and beat up</p>
            <p begin="00:42:33.177" end="00:42:34.887">by the time they became these </p>
            <p begin="00:42:35.515" end="00:42:40.990">rather grungy -you know- illustrations <br/>for the 'The Mechanical Bride'</p>
            <p begin="00:42:41.035" end="00:42:43.775">We have a lot of the original material</p>
            <p begin="00:42:43.775" end="00:42:45.011">from which the slides were taken </p>
            <p begin="00:42:45.020" end="00:42:46.556">and much, much more</p>
            <p begin="00:42:46.761" end="00:42:48.481">Here you can see multiple copies </p>
            <p begin="00:42:48.503" end="00:42:51.526">of the L'il Abner which is one that did <br/>make it into the final book.</p>
            <p begin="00:42:54.383" end="00:42:56.656">it was this idea of the exhibit</p>
            <p begin="00:42:57.281" end="00:43:00.260">which we'll also see pop up <br/>later on in his work</p>
            <p begin="00:43:00.688" end="00:43:04.374">came from a book, ... came chiefly <br/>from a book</p>
            <p begin="00:43:04.374" end="00:43:07.254">by his hero and sometime pen-pal <br/>Wyndham Lewis</p>
            <p begin="00:43:07.419" end="00:43:09.941">who wrote a book, <br/>called 'The Doom of Youth'</p>
            <p begin="00:43:09.941" end="00:43:12.782">in which, in the back, had a bunch of </p>
            <p begin="00:43:13.656" end="00:43:19.664">had this section, an appendix <br/>that consisted of transcriptions of</p>
            <p begin="00:43:20.153" end="00:43:22.548">newspaper clippings <br/>and that was all textual</p>
            <p begin="00:43:22.783" end="00:43:25.115">But McLuhan did it <br/>in a kind of different way.</p>
            <p begin="00:43:25.115" end="00:43:26.717">He was looking at text and image together</p>
            <p begin="00:43:27.297" end="00:43:28.823">in The Mechanical Bride.</p>
            <p begin="00:43:29.781" end="00:43:32.240">Brick Bradford start with that exact comic</p>
            <p begin="00:43:32.244" end="00:43:34.454">and here is some other stuff in <br/>the same file.</p>
            <p begin="00:43:34.594" end="00:43:38.045">Flash Gordon. Brick Bradford was a kind <br/>of Flash Gordon, spaceman type.</p>
            <p begin="00:43:39.925" end="00:43:43.301">This isn't the very image that appeared</p>
            <p begin="00:43:43.478" end="00:43:44.572">as Front Page</p>
            <p begin="00:43:44.572" end="00:43:45.840">but he certainly did have -you know-</p>
            <p begin="00:43:45.840" end="00:43:47.149">he would collect things like</p>
            <p begin="00:43:47.149" end="00:43:48.709">the front page <br/>of the New York Times</p>
            <p begin="00:43:48.709" end="00:43:52.550">and look at it -- as he would say <br/>-- "like a work of art."</p>
            <p begin="00:43:54.037" end="00:43:57.887">And here, we have the manuscript <br/>and a typescript for</p>
            <p begin="00:43:58.507" end="00:44:00.627">that opening section <br/>of 'The Mechanical Bride'</p>
            <p begin="00:44:00.627" end="00:44:04.140">which I think, there is a copy <br/>that is being passed around.</p>
            <p begin="00:44:04.245" end="00:44:07.990">A very recent re-edition of that. <br/>I invite you to look at that.</p>
            <p begin="00:44:10.065" end="00:44:11.328">And now this is very important.</p>
            <p begin="00:44:12.566" end="00:44:14.258">It doesn't look like much, I know.</p>
            <p begin="00:44:15.649" end="00:44:16.656">But it's very, very important. </p>
            <p begin="00:44:17.473" end="00:44:19.409">Because what we have now <br/>at the top of the page</p>
            <p begin="00:44:20.167" end="00:44:20.901">and the bottom of the page</p>
            <p begin="00:44:21.701" end="00:44:24.182">are different versions of the </p>
            <p begin="00:44:24.339" end="00:44:25.993">little call outs.</p>
            <p begin="00:44:26.648" end="00:44:30.985">the little kind of captions that appear <br/>in 'The Mechanical Bride'</p>
            <p begin="00:44:31.315" end="00:44:32.684">the way it works, is: </p>
            <p begin="00:44:32.701" end="00:44:33.979">you have the image,</p>
            <p begin="00:44:33.979" end="00:44:35.877">you have the actual little essay proper</p>
            <p begin="00:44:36.025" end="00:44:38.624">and then you have these kind of <br/>punchy questions</p>
            <p begin="00:44:39.181" end="00:44:42.047">In the original <br/>-- see if we can get closer --</p>
            <p begin="00:44:42.115" end="00:44:45.691">In the original, which I can barely <br/>make out on 'Front Page'</p>
            <p begin="00:44:45.705" end="00:44:48.126">It started out with these very</p>
            <p begin="00:44:48.681" end="00:44:50.084">dry and academic</p>
            <p begin="00:44:52.792" end="00:44:54.553">-ly phrased questions, such as:</p>
            <p begin="00:44:55.644" end="00:44:57.056">"What is the effect of the mind <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:44:57.387" end="00:45:01.573">of the presentation of a large number <br/>of unrelated news stories?"</p>
            <p begin="00:45:03.738" end="00:45:06.595">"Is unconnectedness necessary to <br/>objective reporting?" </p>
            <p begin="00:45:07.269" end="00:45:10.977">"Is it possible to achieve at once <br/>local and international panorama</p>
            <p begin="00:45:11.359" end="00:45:12.371">by any other means?"</p>
            <p begin="00:45:12.861" end="00:45:13.974">... and so on.</p>
            <p begin="00:45:14.496" end="00:45:16.295">And then, at the bottom, <br/>what you have </p>
            <p begin="00:45:17.284" end="00:45:18.385">in manuscript is</p>
            <p begin="00:45:18.932" end="00:45:20.484">what ended up in the book</p>
            <p begin="00:45:21.343" end="00:45:22.982">and what he does... <br/>and now he says:</p>
            <p begin="00:45:24.838" end="00:45:26.028">"What's the score here?"</p>
            <p begin="00:45:27.538" end="00:45:29.806">"Why is a page of news a problem <br/>in orchestration?"</p>
            <p begin="00:45:30.852" end="00:45:32.886">"How does the jazzy, <br/>ragtime discontinuity</p>

            <p begin="00:45:34.920" end="00:45:36.955">link up with other modern art forms?"</p>
            <p begin="00:45:37.294" end="00:45:38.397">And you can see what he's done</p>
            <p begin="00:45:38.700" end="00:45:39.787">is in jazzing up his language</p>
            <p begin="00:45:39.959" end="00:45:42.100">what he's started to do is <br/>emulate the very language of</p>
            <p begin="00:45:42.511" end="00:45:48.334">the ad-men that he is studying.</p>
            <p begin="00:45:50.258" end="00:45:51.278">So, it becomes very meta</p>
            <p begin="00:45:52.855" end="00:45:54.643">as a piece of writing.</p>
            <p begin="00:45:56.022" end="00:45:57.796">And much more entertaining.</p>
            <p begin="00:46:00.419" end="00:46:01.208">And now, what I'm showing you </p>
            <p begin="00:46:01.446" end="00:46:05.720">actually the, you'll see, <br/>12, 14 bold</p>
            <p begin="00:46:06.688" end="00:46:08.445">These are actually some pages </p>
            <p begin="00:46:09.071" end="00:46:10.682">that are the instructions </p>
            <p begin="00:46:11.523" end="00:46:14.146">to the makers of the books.</p>
            <p begin="00:46:14.916" end="00:46:15.949">So these are actually the publishers</p>
            <p begin="00:46:16.527" end="00:46:19.130">I guess, Ernst Reichl, <br/>who was the designer</p>

            <p begin="00:46:32.825" end="00:46:36.942">It just took him like 5 or 6 years <br/>to really find a publisher</p>
            <p begin="00:46:37.194" end="00:46:40.445">and get it through publication.</p>
            <p begin="00:46:41.076" end="00:46:46.508">You can see him, complaining, <br/>especially to Ezra Pound</p>
            <p begin="00:46:46.508" end="00:46:48.459">and to Wyndham Lewis in letters</p>
            <p begin="00:46:48.691" end="00:46:49.913">saying - after it's come out,</p>
            <p begin="00:46:50.084" end="00:46:51.195">you'd think that would be <br/>a kind of relief, but</p>
            <p begin="00:46:51.895" end="00:46:52.806">he said "Argh... awful things."</p>
            <p begin="00:46:53.043" end="00:46:56.892">"It's so compromised, it's so normalized."</p>
            <p begin="00:46:58.251" end="00:47:00.140">And he really wanted to have something <br/>that was much more</p>
            <p begin="00:47:02.118" end="00:47:03.738">hybrid, much more polymorphous <br/>much more fun!</p>
            <p begin="00:47:05.237" end="00:47:06.651">Much more, probably, spontaneous. </p>
            <p begin="00:47:07.953" end="00:47:09.049">And so he really wasn't happy.</p>

            <p begin="00:47:21.722" end="00:47:24.770">Here's another example</p>
            <p begin="00:47:24.770" end="00:47:27.819">Now a publication</p>

            <p begin="00:47:32.733" end="00:47:37.092">And 'Counterblast' was a book <br/>that came out in 1954.</p>
            <p begin="00:47:38.156" end="00:47:39.694">The story behind this, is that<br/></p>
            <p begin="00:47:40.691" end="00:47:44.328">his buddy Ted Carpenter, the <br/>anthropologist,</p>
            <p begin="00:47:46.417" end="00:47:48.377">brought to his attention <br/>something that is generally called </p>
            <p begin="00:47:48.577" end="00:47:49.696">the 'Massey Report'</p>
            <p begin="00:47:49.900" end="00:47:52.942">which was a federal document </p>
            <p begin="00:47:53.398" end="00:47:55.996">that was basically summing up <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:47:56.418" end="00:47:57.953">the state of Canadian culture</p>
            <p begin="00:47:58.635" end="00:48:00.444">and saying what we need to do about it.</p>
            <p begin="00:48:01.190" end="00:48:04.702">And Marshall McLuhan just thought it was <br/>the most hilarious thing he had ever read.</p>
            <p begin="00:48:06.303" end="00:48:07.619">And he immediately set to work</p>
            <p begin="00:48:08.650" end="00:48:12.208">in writing a kind of parodic commentary </p>
            <p begin="00:48:12.618" end="00:48:14.764">on the 'Massey Report'</p>
            <p begin="00:48:14.764" end="00:48:16.910">which is this thing called Counterblast</p>
            <p begin="00:48:16.910" end="00:48:19.056">which is,in this style, very much, <br/>of Blast</p>
            <p begin="00:48:20.333" end="00:48:22.221">by Wyndham Lewis</p>
            <p begin="00:48:22.221" end="00:48:24.109">which you may be familiar with.</p>

            <p begin="00:48:26.744" end="00:48:27.746">so he's been kind of playing in there.</p>

            <p begin="00:48:47.711" end="00:48:49.433">that was really, very dear to Marshall</p>
            <p begin="00:48:49.615" end="00:48:50.768">and he had more control over.</p>
            <p begin="00:48:51.269" end="00:48:57.096">And that was, I suppose, typically <br/>satisfying because it was collaborative</p>
            <p begin="00:48:57.429" end="00:48:59.002">which is something that we'll see <br/>more and more of too</p>
            <p begin="00:48:59.376" end="00:49:02.099">as we survey his literacy.</p>
            <p begin="00:49:02.893" end="00:49:07.076">... was this series called 'Explorations'</p>

            <p begin="00:53:46.323" end="00:53:48.602">initial version of 'Understanding Media'</p>
            <p begin="00:53:48.852" end="00:53:50.485">which had a fairly different form</p>
            <p begin="00:53:52.191" end="00:53:53.202">and so, there we go --</p>
            <p begin="00:53:53.733" end="00:53:55.341">there is his bound copy and as you can see</p>
            <p begin="00:53:55.341" end="00:53:56.848">It does what 'Understanding Media' does.</p>
            <p begin="00:53:56.848" end="00:54:00.171">the 1960 book that takes each</p>
            <p begin="00:54:02.537" end="00:54:05.097">medium and discusses it separately</p>
            <p begin="00:54:05.323" end="00:54:06.725">in this case, a kind of dry approach</p>
            <p begin="00:54:07.051" end="00:54:10.594">same thing that happened in <br/>'The Mechanical Bride'</p>
            <p begin="00:54:10.932" end="00:54:13.950">he eventually jazzes it up <br/>for the final version.</p>
            <p begin="00:54:15.504" end="00:54:16.866">It has exhibits, you know about those.</p>
            <p begin="00:54:18.196" end="00:54:19.558">these are appendices.</p>
            <p begin="00:54:20.912" end="00:54:22.104">Here's one of the appendices </p>
            <p begin="00:54:22.104" end="00:54:23.742">Exhibit two!</p>
            <p begin="00:54:23.742" end="00:54:28.126">And what it is... It's a transcript of <br/>a 1960 television program</p>
            <p begin="00:54:28.126" end="00:54:31.140">that helped Marshall put it together</p>
            <p begin="00:54:31.329" end="00:54:36.827">for CBC. Cause it started <br/>Marshal McLuhan being Marshall McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:54:37.992" end="00:54:42.322">and already, I mean very much <br/>being Marshall McLuhan already in 1960.</p>
            <p begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:50.727">That's a cover of my copy of <br/>'Understanding Media', the '64 book</p>
            <p begin="00:54:51.078" end="00:54:52.040">But there's the </p>
            <p begin="00:54:52.302" end="00:54:58.606">the jazzier the paperback version</p>
            <p begin="00:55:00.892" end="00:55:06.250">1967 was the year of the great book <br/>'The Medium is the Massage'</p>
            <p begin="00:55:06.602" end="00:55:09.823">I don't need to go <br/>to the history of that book.</p>
            <p begin="00:55:10.072" end="00:55:10.322">other book, produced by <br/>Jerome Agel and Quentin Fiore</p>
            <p begin="00:55:10.322" end="00:55:16.302">along with McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:55:16.559" end="00:55:19.570">Because, this week, it's coming out</p>
            <p begin="00:55:19.845" end="00:55:21.714">brand new book on the subject <br/>by Jeffrey Schnapp</p>
            <p begin="00:55:22.066" end="00:55:22.915">which is incredible.</p>
            <p begin="00:55:23.374" end="00:55:24.582">I think, it's one of the best things, </p>
            <p begin="00:55:24.762" end="00:55:25.865">published on McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:55:26.337" end="00:55:29.461">in recent years. </p>
            <p begin="00:55:30.937" end="00:55:31.709">It's very interesting.</p>
            <p begin="00:55:31.792" end="00:55:33.045">It's really about</p>
            <p begin="00:55:35.467" end="00:55:40.034">this impressario, <br/>this new kind of publisher Jerome Agel</p>
            <p begin="00:55:40.677" end="00:55:43.513">I don't know how to pronounce his name <br/>A-G-E-L</p>
            <p begin="00:55:50.089" end="00:55:52.913">He put together Marshall McLuhan <br/>and the designer Quentin Fiore</p>
            <p begin="00:55:52.913" end="00:55:55.737">to make the book <br/>'The Medium is the Massage'</p>
            <p begin="00:55:55.737" end="00:55:58.562">but also many many other books </p>
            <p begin="00:55:59.197" end="00:56:01.251">Some of which were bombed <br/>some of which were successes</p>
            <p begin="00:56:01.539" end="00:56:04.785">and the masterpiece is actually the book <br/>on Buckminster Fuller</p>
            <p begin="00:56:05.040" end="00:56:06.392">Called 'I seem to be a Verb'</p>
            <p begin="00:56:06.544" end="00:56:08.936">It's incredible. <br/>It's an amazing book.</p>
            <p begin="00:56:09.048" end="00:56:12.289">and still, very much, you know, <br/>you can buy it used</p>
            <p begin="00:56:14.328" end="00:56:17.249">And I really recommend it. <br/>Also Carl Sagan and others</p>
            <p begin="00:56:17.398" end="00:56:21.604">So that 'Medium is a Massage' <br/>was part of a series</p>
            <p begin="00:56:21.787" end="00:56:23.984">featuring various kind of intellectuals </p>
            <p begin="00:56:25.582" end="00:56:27.881">It also came out, <br/>as many of you may know, </p>
            <p begin="00:56:28.184" end="00:56:28.561">in LP form. </p>
            <p begin="00:56:31.875" end="00:56:34.692">Also, as you may or may not know, </p>
            <p begin="00:56:35.472" end="00:56:37.661">it came out as 'Aspen 4'</p>
            <p begin="00:56:38.313" end="00:56:39.312">which is a magazine in a box.</p>
            <p begin="00:56:40.139" end="00:56:43.289">In issue 4 Aspen was designed</p>
            <p begin="00:56:43.688" end="00:56:45.067">'The Medium is a Massage'</p>
            <p begin="00:56:45.738" end="00:56:48.500">It was designed by Quentin Fiore</p>
            <p begin="00:56:48.953" end="00:56:51.386">It was really all the text </p>
            <p begin="00:56:53.057" end="00:56:55.281">and no doubt, many of the ideas</p>
            <p begin="00:56:55.673" end="00:56:59.734">for the design as well came from <br/>Marshall McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:56:59.810" end="00:57:01.615">It's this kind of grab-bag. Here's a poster.</p>
            <p begin="00:57:02.514" end="00:57:07.591">Here's various little booklets and things <br/>that it consists of</p>
            <p begin="00:57:09.366" end="00:57:10.328">Beautifully, lavishly produced.</p>
            <p begin="00:57:11.691" end="00:57:13.767">I'm sorry about to dwell on any of this</p>
            <p begin="00:57:14.047" end="00:57:16.637">But what I'm really trying to do is, <br/>saturate you with </p>
            <p begin="00:57:17.252" end="00:57:21.335">a sense of the totality of this </p>
            <p begin="00:57:21.844" end="00:57:25.159">and the kind of feeling, <br/>and the texture of it.</p>
            <p begin="00:57:28.109" end="00:57:32.211">69 McLuhan had the means</p>
            <p begin="00:57:32.395" end="00:57:36.519">to produce a much fancier version of <br/>'Counterblast'</p>
            <p begin="00:57:37.475" end="00:57:40.267">So that is the book 'Counterblast' <br/>the one that up until this year</p>
            <p begin="00:57:40.489" end="00:57:43.612">was the only really fully published version</p>
            <p begin="00:57:43.837" end="00:57:45.422">opposed to these mimeographs <br/>that he sent out.</p>
            <p begin="00:57:50.748" end="00:57:53.634">And now for something really unknown </p>
            <p begin="00:57:54.123" end="00:57:55.366">and really quite special</p>
            <p begin="00:57:57.120" end="00:57:58.308">which are these publications,</p>
            <p begin="00:57:59.324" end="00:58:00.223">series of publications,</p>
            <p begin="00:58:00.349" end="00:58:01.868">called 'The DEW Line Reports'</p>
            <p begin="00:58:02.611" end="00:58:04.873">and you know about McLuhan and the <br/>DEW Line</p>
            <p begin="00:58:05.059" end="00:58:07.902">the idea of the distance <br/>early warning system</p>
            <p begin="00:58:08.357" end="00:58:12.836">and how Canadian culture <br/>is a kind of DEW line</p>
            <p begin="00:58:13.369" end="00:58:14.419">because we can, kind of, <br/>see American culture coming</p>
            <p begin="00:58:18.096" end="00:58:20.378">Just like we didn't see American, <br/>you know,</p>
            <p begin="00:58:20.566" end="00:58:22.045">the missiles coming from Russia... <br/>-- anyway --</p>
            <p begin="00:58:24.018" end="00:58:25.491">This is another one of these fellows </p>
            <p begin="00:58:27.405" end="00:58:28.718">Like Mr. Agel</p>
            <p begin="00:58:28.880" end="00:58:35.223">There was a fellow named Schwartz. Gene <br/>Schwartz who was a New York adman</p>
            <p begin="00:58:35.651" end="00:58:37.688">One of these Madison Avenue 'Madmen'</p>
            <p begin="00:58:38.657" end="00:58:44.055">who was, who really kind of, <br/>looked up to McLuhan</p>
            <p begin="00:58:44.363" end="00:58:46.928">He was very, very big. <br/>You know in advertising circles of the 60s</p>
            <p begin="00:58:47.424" end="00:58:51.276">There was also Howard Gossage in <br/>San Francisco</p>
            <p begin="00:58:51.640" end="00:58:54.357">There a lot of these impressarios of </p>
            <p begin="00:58:54.692" end="00:58:58.298">forward-thinking people, <br/>very forward-thinking </p>
            <p begin="00:58:58.695" end="00:59:02.876">hip, business of advertising.</p>
            <p begin="00:59:03.647" end="00:59:05.058">This guy Eugene Schwartz said:</p>
            <p begin="00:59:05.124" end="00:59:07.704">"Why don't we do this series... <br/></p>
            <p begin="00:59:07.888" end="00:59:10.056">... of little publications <br/>called 'The DEW-Line Reports'?</p>
            <p begin="00:59:11.547" end="00:59:12.830">And they take many forms.</p>
            <p begin="00:59:13.000" end="00:59:14.490">So, here in 1968 is the first one </p>
            <p begin="00:59:14.786" end="00:59:18.988">I don't really want, again, <br/>I don't have time to belabour the content.</p>
            <p begin="00:59:19.198" end="00:59:20.982">I just want to flash through.</p>
            <p begin="00:59:22.764" end="00:59:24.092">Here the hand is helpful, right?</p>
            <p begin="00:59:24.218" end="00:59:25.649">As you can see, that that one is <br/>really small.</p>
            <p begin="00:59:26.301" end="00:59:30.220">I just want to flash through <br/>a bunch of these</p>
            <p begin="00:59:30.344" end="00:59:33.904">to show you the variety of forms <br/>that they took.</p>
            <p begin="00:59:34.165" end="00:59:36.031">There is a poster popping out .. just like </p>
            <p begin="00:59:36.414" end="00:59:40.643">a poor man's version of the Aspen 4.</p>
            <p begin="00:59:40.833" end="00:59:41.793">It's very hard to see here.</p>
            <p begin="00:59:42.266" end="00:59:43.896">But there's actually, you can --</p>
            <p begin="00:59:44.088" end="00:59:46.169">-- this is kind of translucent / <br/>semi-translucent paper</p>

            <p begin="00:59:49.134" end="00:59:53.323">Here's one 'DEW-Line Report', <br/>now onto 1969</p>
            <p begin="00:59:53.508" end="00:59:55.537">that looks like a newspaper </p>
            <p begin="00:59:57.953" end="00:59:59.765">And it has an ad for the <br/>'DEW-Line Report' in it.</p>
            <p begin="01:00:02.400" end="01:00:04.293">We see a lot of this stuff coming up</p>
            <p begin="01:00:04.462" end="01:00:06.158">this kind of folding in and <br/></p>
            <p begin="01:00:06.951" end="01:00:10.109">It gets very messy.</p>
            <p begin="01:00:11.213" end="01:00:13.368">In productive ways in the late 60s.</p>
            <p begin="01:00:13.646" end="01:00:15.733">Here's another one with a sort of <br/>Lichtenstein-esque BANG.</p>
